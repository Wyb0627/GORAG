glorification	Not a holocaust denier just read about it realized it didnt happen the way the said like when Auschwitz changed their sign from 4 million dead to 1.5 million. That kind of brings the 6 million into question. To deny there were no atrocities that occurred during WW2 to Jews would be stupid. There is overwhelming evidence of it. Was it blown way out of proportion? Yes. Is there evidence of it? Yes. If you believe 6 million Jews were killed then you have a differing opinion than Auschwitz.
glorification	That some degree of ethnocentrism is healthy for a population? That fascism is underappreciated as a means of social organisation due largely to the the unchecked power of the media-propaganda complex during and after the second world war? That the whole skinhead aesthetic just oozes cool? [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or maybe that I'm just a fucking racist nazi. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Little from column A, little from column B, really.
glorification	The first guy was trying to run away, can clearly see on the video he turns himself sideways in an attempt to push past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The chick outside was screaming *help me* when he shot her in the head, definitely wasn't lifeless yet. Not the worst/most brutal thing I've ever watched but that part was still pretty fucked up.
glorification	And? Why do y'all be caring about Libya but Mauritania has been having it widespread since the 1600s? Maybe cuz not all Libyan slaves be black?  I just be saying...  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: actually ion care about neither one of em. The milkshakes more interesting than that.
glorification	Imagine if Hitler came back today and saw that Nazis are still alive. He be proud. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then he see the Nazi Furries and it be the Final Solution 2: Electric Boogaloo as he chooses to exterminate furries.
glorification	I just picked up some cheap solvents there. Thanks home depot. When people ask me where I lay on the political spectrum i just say "Hitler was awesome and Stalin was a badass."
glorification	Nah, Hitler's Germany wasn't true Nazism, it was State Fascism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] *Real* Nazism has never been tried, and in fact real Nazism is an ethos of equality and love.
glorification	Just five bullets and tsarism war ended for all time, I really have to give Lenin credit for the expediency of his solution.
glorification	Getting drunk and pirating Minecraft tonight not because I support gamers but because I support notch's nazi beliefs
glorification	Its like a class field trip, I'm hard the entire time. God I miss driving those buses
person_directed_counter_speech	>Pewdiepie follows a rather large number of fascists on twitter,  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Cite. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >and has hosted Ben Shapiro and reviewed Jordan Peterson, both of which are gateways to the altright.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's funny how many NPCs use the same "gateway drug" rhetoric people used to use with weed, only with politics. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >On a side note, I don't know how anyone can see how much hatred he had in his voice and expression when he used the n word to denigrate someone, but I could never support someone like that.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm black, and I've blurted out that word in anger before.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also like how you're ignoring the context; he was playing PUBG and got mad at the opposition. I don't think the other player character was even black. Oh, and he apologized. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > In any case, he's no friend of the gays, since he is a friend to fascists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unsupported premise. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >And btw, t series is basically Bollywood vevo. That's what his sub war is with. Indian vevo. There's a reason people call those who say everywhere "subscribe to pewdiepie" children [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh no! *People*! It's not like anyone has ever made a single cogent criticism about increasing  corporate influence on Youtube! [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] >>I just hate that a corporation might be the most highly subscribed channel on YouTube [linebreak]  [linebreak] >If you for one second think it even matters, you gotta really think about YouTube as a platform. Also at this point, what makes peqfiepie any different than some large corporation. He has millions and deals and all that shit. He's not some innocent little indie blogger... [linebreak]  [linebreak] T-Series earned a hundred million in seven months from Youtube. They're Goliath, not David. Good job deliberately leaving their side out of the comparison.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Pewds is still significantly more independent than T-Series, and that's what Youtube was built on. It was supposed to be an alternative to mainstream media, not a replacement. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also like the thread where someone posts 'evidence' of Joran Peterson's links to the alt-right, it's criticized, and [all they can do is go "u triggered, you big baby?"](https://np.reddit.com/r/gay_irl/comments/b29k3x/gayirl/eis32iq/) and "ironically" use right wing memes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Not to mention the guy who said supporting free-speech is alt-right.
person_directed_counter_speech	I'm not playing the victim, because I'm not a victim. At no point did I so much as imply that I am a victim of anything. I do however have close relationships with people who have struggled with fertility and have voiced similar opinion, and so my opinion is driven largely by empathy. I think I can be excused for forgetting how scarce such a thing is here. I am also not being aggressive, nor am I demanding that the subject be avoided entirely. If you want a productive discussion, try responding to what I actually said rather than putting words in my mouth.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am saying that a) one person cannot discount the emotional experiences of others based on a single shared circumstance and b) the joke is not a good enough joke to justify the effect it has on people who are sensitive on the issue, especially given the massive audience of this person.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Saying that a "prank" regarding a sensitive subject with next to no comedic value is tasteless is hardly "taking it out on everyone else". It's common sense.
person_directed_counter_speech	Lmao cope harder. I don't care what other people do, but I think it's ridiculous to describe your sexlife as conservative when you've slept with that many people and the average *lifetime* number for the US and UK is around 7.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] > BUUUUT I can see how this seems low for someone who doesn't have friends and never goes out. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lol. Like I said I don't care what other people do. But whiteknighting over a high number of sexual partners is bizarre to people like me, who have no problems maintaining the interest of sexual partners long term and thus never felt the urge to sleep around. You've comparatively slept with a lot of people, you're promiscuous. Own it. Desperately trying to make it sound like the norm is embarrassing and makes you sound really insecure. Ironic
person_directed_counter_speech	so what are you suggesting be a brave idiot and get killed/jailed where u can do nothing to further fight an authoritarian regime? not really a good idea when u have a limited amount of man willing to fight for a greater cause. [linebreak]  [linebreak] and I wasn't really making a case for their bravery I was pointing out that concealing your identity is an extremely necessary precaution for people who want to fight against tyranny which is ultimately one of the most heroic actions one can take. more heroic then making a dumb decision like revealing ur identity.
person_directed_counter_speech	Right mate you need to calm down. I'm explaining why the video was taken down and why authorities acted as they did. If you read what I said rather than jumping straight to child porn, it was an example of what is restricted by the Censorship act. I agree, we need to have the option to gather information for ourselves, but imagine your father was killed in that shooting, and you find out because some fuckwit edgelord mass-messaged his death to everyone in his contact list.
person_directed_counter_speech	Are you telling me to "shut the fuck up" because I asked a question about the culture of this subreddit?  You must be a regular over at r/politics. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] edit: When i first read your comment, I had never heard of or couldn't recall hearing about either example you mentioned.  After briefly reading about both situations I can say that I believe any and all information related to these issues should not be kept from the people.
person_directed_counter_speech	The quote should be one of the more known latin quotes, like "veni vidi vici" or "errare humanum est", which translate pretty poorly and are way better to get your point across originally. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I get your point, but that's a bad analogy. And OP surely isn't much bigger of a person. Compared to all the actual powermods, someone who bans you for breaking the rules is probably not bad at all.
person_directed_counter_speech	She was a refugee in the country legally and she got citizenship from that, the accusation(that isn't based on much of anything and doesnt make much sense) is that she did it to give her brother, who wasnt a refugee somehow and couldnt get a greencard off of his citizen sister and family, citizenship, even though he just immediately moved back to the UK so apparently there was no reason to do it.
person_directed_counter_speech	Why would liking a meme about a frog make me 12? I liked it cause it had a lot of variety, you could really do a lot with that single meme. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And of course people cared about politics before Trump, but people are way more invested into it now than in the past and due to the nature of Trump, debates are much more heated nowadays than in the past.
person_directed_counter_speech	You do realize that back in 2012 when it looked like the electoral college winner might loose the popular vote by a slim margin, [Trump said we needed to abolish the electoral college](https://mobile.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/797125052709949440), that it was a joke, a travesty, and that we shouldn't respect the results and should instead march on DC and have a revolution rather than let the inauguration go through.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Are you calling Trump a moron?
