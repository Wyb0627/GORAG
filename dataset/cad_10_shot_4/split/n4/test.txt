affiliation_directed_animosity	Trump wins: I am so mad, worst president ever, I never said he was going to lose, 98 percent chance polls were still accurate because of that 2 percent, I know we just finished saying only sore losers would dispute the election but hey let's dispute the election because we'll just pretend we didn't tell anyone to stop whining about it being rigged.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bush invaded Iraq: this is awful but I think we'll forgive you if we need you in the future to say "orange man bad".  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Going to war isn't as damaging to American ego than winning an argument with half of america and then forcing the very people who thought he'd lose to eat their own words announcing his victory....well at least until they could all get together in a few days and bandwagon a big excuse to cover being embarrassed that badly.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I almost miss the "94 American intel agencies investigating the election" of 2016, a simpler time, I didn't expect the lie to drag out this long, with this much fanfare, entire contingencies in place for "if mueller is fired before 2024, we will automatically commence orange man bad protest", it's like someone poured a bucket of shit on them as payback for being dicks before the election and they started wearing it as a cape when they lost. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]
affiliation_directed_animosity	>/r/fullcommunism got quarantined a long time ago. Somehow an endless fit was not thrown over it though in billionaire funded right wing propaganda journals. The left is censored all the time, in fact I'd say it's far more extreme than anything extended to the right. [linebreak]  [linebreak] FascistUnited, debateFascism,CA ,smuggies, frenworld, honkler, The_Donald, clownworldwar and other rightwing subreddits are being removed like gays in USSR, but its the left wing that is censored cause one commie sub was quarantined. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Literally a moment cannot pass without us being stabbed in the back by liberals so that they can do some moralistic both sides garbage. [linebreak]  [linebreak] "I wonder why won't liberals side with me in protecting the good name of Stalin and encouraging radical system change through revolution. Thats some real thonk material"  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Liberalism is the ideology of weakness, it knows no strategy but appeasement. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Tell me more mister brave communist revolutionary.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >We do not consider ourselves entitled to the world, we know we have to fight for it. We are used to setbacks and betrayal, a liberal cannot breathe without betraying. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Your entire ideology is "i want yours,gib". Talk about larp.

affiliation_directed_animosity	Everyone can be as uppity as they like but there are times when that can be counterproductive for their alleged goals.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd say Antifa are counterproductive every time they appear in public, in the current environment.   They handed Trump the term  "alt-left" on a plate, enabling his "both sides" story.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] An uppity Antifa gives a huge boost to the growing numbers on the right who have lost faith in democratic processes, see civil war as inevitable and need visible examples of what left wing targets would look like in practice.   Their previous visualisations would have been driving around in pickup trucks shooting hipsters and women with blue hair I guess.  Easy but unsatisfactory in various ways, more like pest destruction than the warfare and honest victory they crave.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Antifa gives them strong, violent men dressed in black, with helmets even.  Anonymous uniforms not people.  Weapons can easily be added so it could feel sort of like a fair fight.   Except the collective weapons and fighting experience of right wingers is such that they could melt the left by pissing on them, there would be no possibility of the left putting up a worthwhile fight.
affiliation_directed_animosity	It's not far fetched at all imo, In fact, It sounds exactly like something the PC/Libtardic Feminists would do to control the narrative, They could buy every seat in every theater without sweating. cpl hundred million dollars is nothing for Disney, and Disney has been taken over by Feminists. Feminists hate Freedom of speech, They hate everything that isn't the way they want it to be. And most of all, they hate men and are very jealous about all our hobbies and stories we've created and following, so they want to destroy it all.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I was suspecting Disney would buy tickets already when the hysteria about this movie started long time ago, and all the fishy things happening surrounding it, well let's just say that in my world it certainly leans more towards boxoffice manipulation.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We already know that lefties love to manipulate results in elections and "news" so why not a "huge" movie in one of the most manly Franchise ever existed only to "transform" it into a political weapon for Feminism.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I seriously doubt it if they didn't do it.
affiliation_directed_animosity	i think that in itself isn't something you should be shamed for. like if we were to flip the situation around, and asked the question of whether it's okay to call the victim of an assault a slut, we meet with a resounding no, because it didn't happen by choice. i think it's lazy to make fun of someone for something they didn't choose. plus, if someone is a virgin because they refuse to shower or are a huge asshole, it's way more productive to make fun of those behaviours, not the result. and if someone is just struggling to meet/chat up someone of their desired gender, why would you mock them for that? [linebreak]  [linebreak] *however*. [linebreak]  [linebreak] if someone is like, a self-identified incel, and they've taken their virginity to be some kind of symptom of a systemic problem with the opposite sex, then they're getting into territory where I'm okay with making fun of them (although even then i tend to feel more sympathy than humour in the situation). and I'd make more fun of them for believing the world is 'chad and stacey' than anything else.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Some of these are tiny groups or even individuals, **NO ONE IS FOR THAT EXCEPT THE MEMBERS OF THOSE GROUPS**. Antifa is even attacking registered democrats, ripping a flag out of their hand and people applaud. There is a big fucking difference. Calling this out doesn't make me alt-right. Even the media coverage of this stuff, Gizmodo, super outspoken for journalist rights and reports of violent acts of the "alt right", but have not said a word about Andy Ngo. This is a clear reporting bias, these people are not reporting news anymore. They're pushing their ideals. [linebreak]   [linebreak] There are even a ton of self inflicted "attacks" that are trying to frame the right. Jessie Smollett might not be the first, but sure as fuck the more visible because he's a celebrity. There is a very clear over-reaction to Trump (and this is coming from someone who voted Bernie in the primaries and then Hillary in the election). When the reaction to the bad not anything better, you're doing something wrong and it's time to look in the mirror if you're looking for an enemy.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Wasn't this intentional?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] They designed the bill to give a small tax cut to the lower and middle class so they can be push the talking points and fool the American public (or at least sell it to their base) into thinking that the bill benefits them.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] But the scam is that the tax bill lowered the taxes for the wealthy elite and massive corporations in a much more skewed and beneficial way, effectively negating any benefit the lower and middle class would have seen had this bill been passed in good faith.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's a con. That's what people are upset about. Too many ignorant people being taken advantage of by liars and propagandists with malicious intent.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Similar to the way the Republicans push the talking points about a potential universal health care system, "But taxes will go up!" they cry, while ignoring that people will pay less overall because of the redundancy of health insurance costs under such a system (obviously this debate would depend on the language of the legislation involved).
affiliation_directed_animosity	it fundamentally places blame on others for their celibacy.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] let me ask, why are you so determined to reclaim this label? why not just involve yourself in communities that give advice on dating and sex for inexperienced people, without the weird, unnecessary, violent baggage from that word ? it seems steeping stone-y to me, idk. you know, get frustrated, yet reasonable people on board. that frustration is bound to turn to anger, right . at least for a few? [linebreak]  [linebreak] this relatively new, fringe internet movement has already two shootings, with a community to cheer them on and muddy the waters for good measure. and god knows how many more on the way. enough is enough  [linebreak]  [linebreak] you can have a tough time with sex and the opposite gender without putting such a label on yourself. god knows i do. but, it's super insensitive to all the lives 'incels' have taken. it's not a label worth reclaiming for whatever 'good' people there are that want to make a personal identity about not getting laid
affiliation_directed_animosity	Another scandalous aspect of this -- North Korea is not communist.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] They quietly dropped all references to Marx/Lenin/etc. back in 1992 and right now it is just a somewhat quirky but not that abnormal in the grand scheme of human history regime of theocratic feudal despotism (the religion being the cult of personality surrounding the Kims).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So why on earth would a r/communism moderator feel the need to ban anyone for criticizing it (setting aside  for a moment that people should only ever be banned for real and serious offenses)? That is somewhat equivalent to someone in the USSR being sent to a GULAG camp in the 1930s for criticizing Mussolini... [linebreak]  [linebreak] But then have you ever seen an SJW who knows anything about history and philosophy...  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In fact the whole SJW phenomenon is to a large degree born out of the total collapse of education in those areas over the last few decades and is sustained by the militant ignorance of the younger generations.
affiliation_directed_animosity	>fuck off? [linebreak]  [linebreak] They didn't even provide a reasonable note for the ban. They just got mad because of something so small and simple as a different thought. They were upset that they were losing an argument and used their moding privilege to silence those who spoke against their beliefs. This shows their weakness, they couldn't take in the opinions. They knew they lost. They felt as though their only move now was to ban and silence. What else could they do? Just lie down and just take it? Ignore it and move on? But they had to get that last hit in somehow, right? [linebreak]  [linebreak] They've got the mindset of a bickering child angered during a losing argument. They're trying to get that last say in no matter what. It was a feeling of success to them. They didn't care how it made them look. All that wanted was a feeling of accomplishment, even if it meant acting scummy to achieve it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: fuck autocorrect
affiliation_directed_animosity	Lol when did SPS become the mirror of the dramatic shit we read on /r/politics? This [same post](https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9v57rh/a_red_line_crossed_nationwide_protests_declared/ ) was thrown up when Jeff Sessions was fired, and as much as I love laughing at failed movements on Reddit, [there were actually thousands of people protesting peacefully.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/09/no-one-is-above-law-protesters-across-us-say-trump-threatens-muellers-investigation-by-replacing-sessions/) Calling it a "call to riot" is laughable [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of things I absolutely cannot stand when it comes to the left is the whining and overdramatization of everything conservatives do, i.e., "literal Nazis / concentration camps / Hitler," etc. I'm sure many of you can relate. Please please please don't let this sub turn into the same thing  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: With that being said, the doubling down on collusion is fucking fantastic. It's like they reared back for a day or two until Rachel Maddow told them enough times that Barr is corrupt, and now they're taking to the streets. Beautiful.
affiliation_directed_animosity	This is absolutely hilarious. This is exactly what people who advocate for free speech on social media like Jordan Peterson (quite ironic since the leftist YouTuber being censored in this scenario loves to "debunk" his views) have been talking about for years.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] When the "hate speech" crowd asks for specific people or speech to be censored, social media corporations cave in. "Bigots" or "bigoted thoughts" get banned, demonetized, removed, or suspended and people celebrate.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] As the "hate speech" crowd pushes harder, people who aren't even political get punished. People "associated" with "bigots" get punished. Historians get punished. Comedians get punished. Next thing you know, you and your group that loves to combat "hate speech" get punished.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] To anyone who pushes social media censorship and wants to police "hate speech," take a look in the mirror and look what you've done. This is entirely self-inflected.
affiliation_directed_animosity	That'a true.  Most women who call themselves feminists are good people who just don't know that the wage gap or inflated rape statistics are BS.  They don't hate men and would support men who are raped or assaulted (unlike some of the posts that get shared here of peoppe claiming that men can't be raped.)  A lot of them believe basically the same things that I do, that neither men nor women should be discriminated against, violence against anyone is bad, women in poor countries often face the worst of sexism and sexual violence, etc.  They just haven't been exposed to the nasty side of feminism, so while I and many people like me have decided that "feminist" may not be the best word to describe what we believe, they have no resaon to believe that the term might not be the best for them to use.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Furries are in the same point as every other overly enthusiastic nerd for me. I don't want to be near their conventions and the things they say make me cringe, especially when they attempt to interact with other people in a normal manner and fall flat on their face. They're like someone with Aspergers who actually cares what people think about them so their comments are usually dripping with insecurity and "Please laugh at my bad joke, PLEASE". Ugh it's too much for me. It's like when you're playing a videogame with a bunch of your friends and suddenly a girl or women is introduced into the group and all your otherwise normal buddies turn into fucking desperate idiots, completely changing how they act in some sort of pathetic attempt to win favor with this person that they will never see and is thousands of miles away.
affiliation_directed_animosity	I spend more time with women on any given Tuesday than any unloved, lonely shut-in Chapo poster has in his whole fucking life. I might make jokes about women on /r/drama, but IRL I'm one of the fucking girls and fine with it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When any of them open up to me about their experiences with harassment or assault, it is *never* - **NEVER. FUCKING. EVER.** - about a MAGA bro or a frat boy. It is *always* at the hands of some sensitive feminist "woke" boy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The "frat boy rapist" thing is a myth that dangerous dudes like this are happy to perpetuate, because it takes the heat off of them, i.e. the real threats to the goddamn wimminz.

affiliation_directed_animosity	You know what? When that crazy Trump supporter was sending pipe bombs to a bunch of leftist icons, I didn't see any conservatives responding to that by saying "Well, don't forget all of the violent things that antifa does." [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not because the two things are beyond comparison. It's because in tragic situations like that, conservatives are generally able to restrain themselves from resorting to "whataboutism" and trying to redirect the public focus to other things that fit a narrative. You just don't see that kind of restraint as often on the left.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Even when antifa does things that are undoubtedly horrible and can't possibly be justified or defended, then if nothing else the left will try to shift the focus away and demand that people remember all the bad things that right-wing extremists have done instead.
affiliation_directed_animosity	I guess this falls into spirit of an idea vs practice of an idea. When people talk about the horror of eugenics, they're usually referring to the fact that the US *actually sterilized people viewed as inferior*. Certainly, encouragement can be part of it, but only if the encouraged abortion is specifically meant to "improve" the makeup of the race.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] This tweet just reads like someone wanting to out-woke all the other white, middle class liberals. I'm pretty sure she isn't suggesting this as the first stage in a multi-part plan that will also force breeding between all the people she deems superior. Then again, I could be wrong, and she's doing this solely to improve the Gene pool and speed along evolution. If so, I apologise for my arguments.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Empathy seems to be going by the wayside, it's a [linebreak] quality we're encouraged not to embrace. And this modern age of ours is not helping things much with on demand everything. Very little room for engagement. I tried to see things their way and gain a different perspective. Went to the churches. Shot the guns. Listened to their pundits. I never felt welcomed or challenged to change my view. I only ever encountered entrenched hostility from these folks. And the sad thing is that a lot of the ideology isn't even what we're up against. For some of the older folks sure, but the younger people seem to have this need for attention and engagement that isn't even political, or for the sake of displaying their platform.  It's not for me.
affiliation_directed_animosity	I think most incels are pretty young, under the age of 30 usually. It took me until I was 40+ years old to stop being anti-social/a-social due to bullying, rape, being continuously taken advantage of, and then bullying by fellow adults including my parents* until I was ~40 years old [*they apologized once they found out I was autistic].  I could see how a young man growing up in a culture of rape-culture, toxic-masculinity, and precarious masculinity could be that bitter and say the stuff they say on incel forums. However, once they start planning to hurt others and going through with even a small amount of those plans they are criminals and dangerous to everyone around them. I think the [Contrapoints video on incels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD2briZ6fB0) explains my attitude towards them.
affiliation_directed_animosity	I guess this is a valid negareddit opinion, since reddit does like Doctor Who (at least they did before those spooky SJWs cast a woman as the doctor). [linebreak]  [linebreak] But it does sound kind of like the "new version of X has ruined my childhood" reactionary whining we've come to love whenever an old franchise gets rebooted with even a hint of progressiveness.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I mean, most of the people who started watching the new Who weren't going to stumble on old episodes of Hartnell or Baker and get into the fandom that way. But now we have new fans coming in, and the classics are getting some attention. Like the big multi-week stream that Twitch did last year of some of the classic serials.
affiliation_directed_animosity	I feel a sense of basic human duty to help any person who's been as thoroughly benighted and brainwashed by hyper-consumerist escapism as incels, Trump fanatics, etc... I consider it a measure of my own privilege that my own combination of upbringing, education, and luck made me avoid those trappings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That said, a person always has to pick their battles and, more importantly, make sure that they're not wasting their time on people who are lost causes. I'd argue that wrangling these sorts of issues on the internet is probably close to useless. These are people who need to be socialized in a way that doesn't make it super easy to dive back into the Wild West anonymity that online life makes so so easy.
affiliation_directed_animosity	You know what? Fuck this dumb fucking platform (Reddit). Anything political on reddit is such a fucking waste of time, every place is a massive echochamber. Worst thing is the default subreddits that pretend to be neutral that have a clear libtard bias. The whole voting system that burries comments is annoying too. The number of times I had to sort by controversial to get a good opinion is too damn high.  [linebreak] At this point even going on 4chan is way better than this shitty mess. The reddit groupthink is so annoying when you say something remotely controversial or offensive you get downvoted or banned into oblivion. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At least the 4chan faggots don't pretend to be some sort of moral authority all the time.
affiliation_directed_animosity	If she were all of those things except she had Republican policies, then Republicans would love her. It's actually that simple, because they just care about her ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Meanwhile, if she WERE a Republican, the people on the left holding her up would probably refuse to call her 3 out of 5 of those things and claim she doesn't represent the last two all of a sudden. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Evidence of their delusion when waaaay down at the bottom of the thread, someone points out that the right-wing likes Candace Owens so this theory makes no sense. Someone responds with: [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Tokenism? [linebreak]  [linebreak] So they hate AOC because she's 'PoC', but they love Candace Owens because she's 'PoC'.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Drama posting as a whole rots your brain, the sub is easily one of the most transphobic subreddits filled with Enlightened centrists and alt-light trolls, the mod team is a bunch of weirdo nominally left succdems who post on Stupidpol about how they're the bastion of left thought.

affiliation_directed_animosity	In that thread a user links to another sub where the same topic is being discussed.  OP then says [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Yeah, I don't want to jump to the conclusion that it was mass flagging from /pol/ or some other right wing community but that's what it's always been when videos from left YouTube get taken down. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They just can't see past that.  When a left youtube channel get taken down it's due to brigading because there can be no other reason.  When a right youtube channel gets taken down it's because fuck them they deserve it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All that said, I agree, if they weren't calling for violence leave the fool up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edited for clarity
affiliation_directed_animosity	I have a dark sense of humour. I never really make jokes about gays, though.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I mean, I'm sure I've made a joke aimed at a gay man before, but the focus of the humour wasn't in any way related to his sexuality. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My jokes mostly rely on dead baby humour, being a serial killer, or cannibalism (though I hate that word. I prefer to think of myself as a humanitarian). It's not about killing gays, or hating *anyone,* it's about being hungry. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The only group I specifically target is vegetarians and vegans, because they eat what food eats, therefore by the transitive property, they are food. That's not hate, that's just math.
affiliation_directed_animosity	he  claims to be conservative but has fucked around more than most slutty women have, it's either bait, or he's a delusional, hypocritical retard. [linebreak]  [linebreak] but honestly it hits all the right notes too perfectly to not be bait. it's literally designed to trigger progressive lefties. you got the double standards about partner count (dude fucked insane amounts of women but the "mother of his children" must be a pure tradvirgin) you got him signalling about how he's too cool to care about the latest trendy social issues, and some group of feminazi slowly turning his gf against him by poisoning him with such evil ideas about slut shaming being bad. [linebreak]  [linebreak] it's gotta be bait.
affiliation_directed_animosity	It's like when i hear someone use the term "problematic."  I know what they are about to talk about is some minor bullshit that only matters to people who make it a point to show others how woke they are by trying to fix issues that no one asked them to instead of actually focusing on big issues we have that we might be able to address.  It lets me know, not only what kind of person you are, but also that I can ignore what you are about to say in it's entirety.   [linebreak] These people talk about "problematic" issues like "rape culture" and "underemployment" but they don't talk about real shit like "actual rape" or "homelessness."
affiliation_directed_animosity	Chapos are pissy the past few days because Amber, one of the hosts of their super socialist podcast that rakes in over 1M a year (guess how much of that is spent on fixing 'concentration camps'?) came out and said "There's this idea that we live in a white supremacist country when we fundamentally don't", which of course runs counter to Chapo ideology, and now their sub is currently banning anyone who defends her.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every so often I'm ready to throw my hands in the air and give up staying on top of fringe political discussion, and then the left starts to eat itself again and I remember why it's all worth it.
affiliation_directed_animosity	The son of one the wife's auntie dresses like that. He's in early 30's. Mom is a street sweeper, Dad does random jigs here and there. The guy never really worked, never had regular girl friends. He once had a "girlfriend" in Chengdu, while he lives in Nanjing, but he never saw her. He borrowed money to go to Chengdu, he came back from Chengdu a couple of days later : no more "girlfriend", no money and a sad look.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] He dresses like this too, with the same physic. He got a few friends dressing like that,  all diaosi incels doing nothing of their days, spending the little money their parents earn.
affiliation_directed_animosity	They really seem to think left and right wings on a political spectrum are universal. Talking about how right wingers in europe are left compared to right wingers in the US when the reality is that they are just two different ideologies. Having low taxes isn't seen as a conservative opinion in europe, not because having high taxes is just some inevitable position on the journey to a universal left wing, but because they just don't at all have the same history or view of the government and individualism. Leave it to liberals to be incredibly narcissistic and think that their opinion is just some universal truth/goal that all advanced societies will pursue.
affiliation_directed_animosity	I like how you *POST* to rightwing hate subs, but *[DIATRIBE](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diatribe)* to left-leaning subs [linebreak]  [linebreak] Everything the leftist nuts on reddit do is colored by deception and being intentionally misleading lol [linebreak]  [linebreak] ~~PoliticalLeaningBot is just an asbolute lazy dumpsterfire banged out by a script kiddie from r/politics~~, haha, nevermind, it's not even a bot.

affiliation_directed_animosity	when isn't that shit hole seething. The left has an obsession with manufacturing outrage. Nothing is EVER good, ok, or improving. Everyone is evil, the world is ending, corporations control our minds, the KKK is lighting their torches, and the GOP is stealing elections from the popular vote.

affiliation_directed_animosity	Double standards are a cornerstone of liberal groupthink.  It gives them a reason to ultimately feel better about doing nothing particularly spectacular in terms of policy.  The whole party is anti-climactic in policy, so they throw around coined-phrases and labels at the conservatives in the hopes that it will make them stand out.  "Oh, they have African Americans who support their ideologies too?!  Well no African Americans would ever willingly support their ideas so they must be token.. ours aren't Token so we are better."  In reality they do nothing better, and so their modus-operandi has become to justify lackluster realities with some biased or bigoted shit.
affiliation_directed_animosity	These people are NPCs who eat up the carefully curated CNN narrative of the idiot hick Trump supporter. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Most of my friends and family are urban-dwelling educated professionals who make bank, give to their communities and love Trump, and who these nitwits have no idea are standing next to them at farmer's markets and yoga studios.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have a buddy who looks every bit the Pacific northwest liberal but is by far the most based gun-toting libertarian conservative type I have ever met, and is a fucking genius at everything he tries. He is basically undefeated at debate, certainly when talking to libs.
affiliation_directed_animosity	> Do these idiots really think that the report is going to say something different than Barr's summary? [linebreak]  [linebreak] They'll scrape the bottom of the barrel to find anything that could vaguely be interpreted as meaning Orange Man Bad, and start playing the blame game if they can't find anything.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] They've already started with an argument from ignorance: *"But.. but.. it doesn't prove that he didn't do it. See? the wording only means that they couldn't find anything, not that it isn't there! They just need to throw another 100 million dollars into the investigation, and I just know they'll find something!"*
affiliation_directed_animosity	Voat has the same problem of complete lack of management of the site at the administration level. Voat admin and Reddit admin don't understand their product and how to make it fair and tolerable. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah, Voaters were always mostly Redditors. The SJWs  left because they couldn't control the userbase, the moderates left because the dumb  tweens weren't moderated out. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have a con theory, and that's people purposefully troll on the site to keep it intolerable for normal rational mature people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] 100% sure SRS regulars were given control of r/voat to help flush voat down the toilet.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Actually, they're balkanizing the US, trying to segregate people not only by race  and culture but also by geography.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The "melting pot" is racist.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Embracing other cultures is racist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You can only enjoy art made by _____s if you're _____. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unless you're white, then you stole that art from...uh... shut up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I'm pretty sure they know that that means that businesses will fail under this structure but  that's okay, because when your making a better world people have to suffer.  People have to die.  Can't make an omelette without breaking eggs right?

affiliation_directed_animosity	I'll admit some leftists can be a hypocritical in their zeal to go after stereotypical right wing yokels. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I can't speak for anyone else, but I'm a lefty who hates tankies just as much as I hate capitalists, and I've attended survivalist meetups and gun shows with a largely right wing crowd no problem. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe the "anti-authoritarian" left could be a little more critical of tankies, or maybe the libertarian left and the right can never truly see eye to eye on any level. Idk. Politics is mostly based on meaningless cultural divides in the first place.
affiliation_directed_animosity	They've made a decision before looking at any evidence, if they look at all. Like Covington. The mainstream media story was so far from what actually happened, what an atrocity. They read about how Trump bad and since it aligns with their existing world view it most be true. They want it to be true. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Same thing with Iran going on right now. People literally like "LOL trusting the word of the US government over Iran". Then it's like why do you trust Iran over the US? Because concentration camps and orange man bad. Then they just compound it.
affiliation_directed_animosity	T_D was BRUTAL with its moderation.  Overzealous if anything. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The admins had all sorts of special ~~harassment~~ rules just for that sub alone.  They couldn't afford to allow any rule breaking. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of the T_D mods got sick of the shit and shut the sub down for a couple days, making a huge stink about the absolute bullshit the admins were putting them through. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Admin reaction?  Suspended those mods.  such assholes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So no, the issue was never with moderation, the issue is that the admins here hate T_D,  and America in general really.
affiliation_directed_animosity	If you're not breaking the law you have nothing to fear. So many there peddling that bs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I reported being involuntarily drugged in my workplace to the police, who refused to file a report, and the cop literally said "what crime has been committed here?". So according to this cop, people can spike your drink or food with whatever the fuck they want without repurcussion. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What is even more mind-boggling is that this wasn't some precursor to sexual assault or whatever, which I expected would be treated much worse. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Fuck the cops.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Notice how when a leftist described a black or brown politician they always immediately jump to "articulate" or "classy"? It's the default thing they say about Obama. Like when Biden said Obama was the first black guy to run who was "clean". [linebreak]  [linebreak] I never see them say the same stuff about their white politicians. It's pure low expectations racism. Just imagine talking about your black friend and saying "yea, my back friend is cool. And he even talks well! And he's clean! How cool is that?" My black friends would punch me in the face.
affiliation_directed_animosity	the group that you're choosing to identify yourself with is a prime breeding ground for violence and bigotry, whose 'involuntary' identifier literally places the blame on women for depriving them of something they deem essential. if incels actually cared about personal responsibility they wouldn't have gone with that name in the first place. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  you might not think you treat women different in real life, but the internet *is* real life. case in point: im scared to go to yoga now, and guess whose fault that is? the people who you're going to bat for.
affiliation_directed_animosity	To answer the question in the title, they would rather that you refer to them "people with vaginas", "people with ovaries and a uterus", or "people who menstruate", depending on whether you're talking about reproduction, sexytimes, or menstruation, respectively. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I realize that what I just wrote sounds like a bizarre parody of what a conservative thinks these people say. But I swear to God, these *really are* the bizarre backwards euphemisms that well-meaning liberals came up with to seem more accepting of trans people, and are now trying to inflict upon the world.
affiliation_directed_animosity	They're gonna kill someone soon. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then Antifa and it's sympathizers won't have an excuse... [linebreak]  [linebreak] ...Or they'll play the stupid numbers game... [linebreak]  [linebreak] The only major Lefties I know that completely oppose this nonsense is Trevor Noah and Noam Chomsky (I believe). [linebreak]  [linebreak] ...Everyone else either ignores it to focus on *smiling kids,* "Antifa isn't ACTUALLY violent, ignore what your eyes see," (Vox is pretty bad about this and you can get why when Carlos is leading the charge there, lol) or endorses it in some fashion ("Milkshaking is okay").
affiliation_directed_animosity	>younger people seem to have this need for attention and engagement that isn't even political [linebreak]  [linebreak] I think it's the whole incel thing that they are secluded and lonely and trying to find something to bond over. And the conservative grifters seem really good at taking taking incel loneliness and weaponizing it. I personally don't get how all of them didn't learn introspection because no matter how sad and lonely I am I know most of my problems are my own and most people just want to live a secure and happy life.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Then they tell you "create your own platform" so [they do ](https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/249414/hatreon-a-crowdfunding-site-for-bigots-is-exhibit-a-for-why-kicking-them-off-social-platforms-doesnt-solve-the-problem) but then they still go and Lobby to get them [shut down](https://hornet.com/stories/makersupport-shutdown-alt-right-crowdfunding)  including by going to every payment provider available and completely [shutting them out of the market](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2017/08/18/visa-paypal-mastercard-hate-groups-charlottesville)  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The meme that people can just go create their own thing is absolute and utter bullshit. And the left absolutely knows it. Look what they did to Anglin with the stormer. Just like AHS there is more of a push to shut down mean words than actual pedophilia and such. It's insanity.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Are you an npc repeating yourself because you ran into a logic loop? [linebreak]  [linebreak] No, you started the message with "Why was I banned **again**", which means "he straight up banned without any warning at first." is wrong. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You also said "I didn't break any rules", also wrong because you couldn't be arsed to read them, and saying it's not offensive to show OCD suffers something like that is like saying fireworks are okay next to grandpa who suffers ptsd. Differing outcomes, but on average you shouldn't fucking do it.
affiliation_directed_animosity	To be fair, calling a woman "cute" or "adorable" in a professional setting is inappropriate. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] However the writer goes beyond that, and gives a shopping list of petty grievances, including: [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] \- Scarlett Johansson's "yellowface" performance [linebreak]  [linebreak] \- Being mistaken for a "South Asian" person (sure, she, as a Korean was mistaken for an  Indian) [linebreak]  [linebreak] \- White people spread racism unknowingly through compliments and "microaggressions" [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's almost a bid for SJW victimhood cred disguised as an opinion piece.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Meh, "getting laid is easy" is probably one of the dumbest angles possible on incels, that has nothing to do with what truly make incels bad and put too much weight on them having sex to stop being incels instead of just dropping the ideology. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The implication that you *should* have sex at all cost even with someone you are not attracted to is not super cool either and would probably fuck up an incel even more while making them much less likely to listen to normal people ever again.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Yes, they've resulted in the deaths of REAL human beings on at least four separate occasions. What would you call that? [linebreak]  [linebreak] They discuss acting out violently all the time and some have followed through. Violence doesn't have to be driven by religion or race to be considered terrorism. Sexist violence inspired by a misogynistic ideology still qualifies as terrorism. It's just that violence against women is unfortunately so run-of-the-mill that it's been normalized, we're desensitized-- and so the notion that this could be terrorism doesn't immediately occur.
affiliation_directed_animosity	> And the left is absolutely too fucking damaged and propagandized to understand that they reason things are the way they are now is because of DEMOCRATS...namely Janet Reno: [linebreak]  [linebreak] And they are going to be incredibly disappointed when the report matches Barr's summary. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Come on... what motivation would he have to lie, especially knowing that the report would eventually be released to the public.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Do these idiots really think that the report is going to say something different than Barr's summary?
affiliation_directed_animosity	I'm still so confused as to why SO many of them turn out to predators? Is it that all of these people plan to prey on women or are they just in-self aware [linebreak]  [linebreak] Kinda reminds me of this guy I knew that talked a lot about consent and female empowerment but ended up coming onto me on our third date despite me being a total virgin. Doesn't really sound bad but I guess it was the discrepancy of our experience that set me off
affiliation_directed_animosity	>American still capable of thinking objective thoughts generally agree with you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Unfortunately at this point there is pretty much nothing that the average American citizen can do unless he is willing to just give up his life to kill as many Republicans as he can. Which itself would be counterproductive as fuck unless thousands of other Americans decided to do the same thing about the same time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh yeah, it's only the Republicans and gunowners who're dumb and paranoid, yeah that's it.
affiliation_directed_animosity	I'm from Mass. Fall River is full of blue collar Portuguese people that could Care fucking less about Jews. Also, my state is the bluest damn one in the country, other than California, and we all know how much a leftist loves a hate crime - enough to hoax one. This is the home of snotty liberal college and the Kennedys... Altho I'm almost positive JFK would be called a fascist by them if he lived now.  [linebreak] Everyone here thinks this is utter bullshit.
affiliation_directed_animosity	if you want a good laugh, put "white feminism" in the search bar, which is how feminists only care about things that benefit white women(despite their insistence that they want universal equality), are insensitive to WOC, and how they often start to shed crocodile tears about how upset they are or how you're victimizing for calling them out on it. It's funny how fast "not all men" turns into "not all white women" in white feminism threads, one standard for me, another for thee
affiliation_directed_animosity	This discussion is happening because of this article; [Bangladesh: Mysterious Person On Killing Spree of Rapists](https://outline.com/4vpnCp), which is pretty dramatic itself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One user on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/an1z8q/mysterious_person_on_killing_spree_of_rapists/), WarriorMonkey, is very huffy with everyone and is replying to almost all comments with threats and vitriol.

affiliation_directed_animosity	>I actually do kind of sympathise with OP in that there are a bunch of parasite rent-seekers trying to insert themselves into a system that doesn't need them.

affiliation_directed_animosity	TBF youtube is owned by Google(Alphabet) whose internal management is held by people from far left, and are overtly so in showcasing their opinion in public. So this should not come as a surprise to you. In the coming few days, the western media is going to intensify its offensive against the Modi govt, and google is going to be at the front of it, since it controls how media reaches you - through chrome suggestions, youtube recommendations, ad placement(the biggest one).

Long shot, but we'll see how this goes.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Oh I agree but I think this has the power to do the opposite. Right now, jannies have the excuse of "I do it for the satisfaction of keeping a healthy community" blah blah blah. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd they're getting paid, that excuse goes out the window and everyone is going to freak out about shills even more than they do now. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I see no way that this goes well and dozens of ways that this goes wrong.
affiliation_directed_animosity	beyond that, tumblr has a ton of conservative wingnuts as well. there's tons of terf and transmed shit, as well as open white supremacists cluttering up the content on top of all the inarticulate kids who are just dipping their toes into leftist ideologies [linebreak]  [linebreak] and then like, any time someone gets in a slapfight with one of those other groups, someone posts it to TIA captioned "IT'S BEGINNING! THE LEFT IS EATING ITSELF!!" or some such tripe
affiliation_directed_animosity	They don't consider themselves feminists. In fact, they think it is feminists fault that they are not a CEO despite 90%+ of CEOs still being men. Stuff like this. [linebreak]  [linebreak] However, they are so thirsty that they automatically side with the women in any story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Yta. I would be happy if a woman would go out with me even if don't spend the night together. How dare you to have sex despite I'm being much nicer."
affiliation_directed_animosity	While you're technically right, because a lot of Germans did not like the Commies and Hitler's opposition to them certainly helped gain appeal, I hope people do not overstate how much of this contributed to Hitler's rise to power, and that we remember the other mechanisms that also helped him get into power (namely, the blame game, "I'll fix everything," talented speaking, a good crisis to exploit, etc). [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah, Commies Commying certainly did not help, lmao.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Reddit is an incredible mess at this point. There have been countless site wide controversy's over the years. So many mass migrations, mass deletions and mass condemnations.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Admins and power Mods have no shame, or honour. How much they are being paid to shill would be interesting to know. But for what they did to what used to be a free speech platform the showed the popular stories of the day, there will be no forgiveness.
affiliation_directed_animosity	no, it's just redditors being virtue signalling losers in echo chambers. leddit is filled with anti social losers who adopt woke ideologies and think they're fighting the good fight by commenting. just look at chapo. obviously not everyone is as extreme as them but ledditors in general are subservient, meek, trying hard to be progressive. there's no need for conspiracy theories and mod interference, leddit  is literally just a trash website filled with losers in echo chambers
affiliation_directed_animosity	Cue the flood of triple parentheses blue checkmark "journalists" spewing out articles saying "As a white ally, it's not my place to comment on this, but I'm going to go ahead and comment on this anyway and say that black people should be held to a lower standard than everyone else.  They shouldn't be prosecuted for violent crimes because they don't know any better cause they was oppressed and sheeeeeeit.  Signed, your woke sista Sarah Goldsteinstein.  Hollaaaaaaa!"
affiliation_directed_animosity	The people commenting are crazy, but the article is bad, too. Is it suggesting that because the republicans followed the constitution and appointed two judges (to replace two similarly minded judges, so it didn't cause too much political shift) it is not fair and so the laws should be changed to let the democrats pack the court? Democrats sound like the kid that makes up rules to play ground games so that they don't lose.
affiliation_directed_animosity	I read an article very recently about how men are dying as a result of fentanyl at a rate three times that of women, where just a few years ago the rates were similar. It made me think "THIS is what men's rights people should be concerned about! look at this terrible drug epidemic that is disproportionately affecting men!"  [linebreak]  [linebreak] But since it doesn't involve shitting on women, who cares.

Literally right wingers have done the same thing to democrats a thousand times, the second it happens to right wingers they throw a temper tantrum and shooting the holy cop of yore.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Andy Ngo or that older guy could have been killed with the level of violence they've risen to.  When you beat someone in the head to the point they have to go to the hospital with a brain hemorrhage, you're dangerously close to killing someone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I love how they pretend these were just 'milkshakes', when they were laced with quick drying cement, a dangerous chemical when it comes in contact with skin.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Icing on the cake, r/Fuckthealtright bans me from participating even though I've never visited the sub before. Because you know, being against actual fucking violence is alt-right now. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why does the extreme left seems to be more violent and more prevalent than the thing they stand against. I'm all for fighting nazis but I don't see actual nazis, I do see people behaving like nazi's but they're calling themselves anti-fascists... wtf.
affiliation_directed_animosity	The whole thread is hilarious. Amber (or the other girl) makes fun of the idea that these idiots think the US is fascist white supremacist state... but cth somehow interprets this as "they are saying systemic racism doesn't exist anymore reeeeeee". [linebreak]  [linebreak] I mean, do you need proof these people are only capable of thinking in extremes? Look at how they react to literally anything.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] God Bless Amber A'Lee.
affiliation_directed_animosity	idk about voat, i just checked it out and it just seems like a bunch of conservatives jacking each other off; that could just be the home page though. What really concerns me is a looked for about 2 seconds just to find incels defending loli porn on a gaming subreddit because it's "censorship" if they have to look on a different sub to jack off to their favorite characters (?).
affiliation_directed_animosity	Look at how the r/mensrights sub is terrible! [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Men's lib ... are so toxic to masculinity that even feminists say 'woah dude, not cool.' [linebreak]  [linebreak] In one sentence they have totally misrepresented Toxic Masculinity *and* talked about TERFs as representing feminism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh well, what can you expect from a group that fellates Daddy Kermit because he told them to wash and hit their children
affiliation_directed_animosity	The only people committing violence in Charlottesville were Leftists and it wasn't just 'antifa'.  Fox News was sitting there all morning talking about nazis while in the background of their reporter people were flinging rocks up over the walls of the park.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] One mentally ill kid fleeing the area doesn't mean you can say there was anything wrong with the people protesting the statue being pulled down.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Cosmo, and some more progressive schools in the guise of "health Ed". The slope keeps slipping,  and the defense of "they are going to do it anyway" keeps getting steeper. It's gone from "explain condoms" to "teach alternative techniques".  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It may not quite be down to 13 yet.. but it will be soon. Progressivism requires robbing children of any innocence as early as possible.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]

affiliation_directed_animosity	I don't know if this picture is the Sandy Hook kids. I don't know if those kids ever even existed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I do know [nobody died at Sandy Hook](https://rense.com/general96/NobodyDiedAtSandyHook_final.pdf), and the people that do these kinds of hoaxes are capable of having all the "victims" together for a picture to mock all of us. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Occultists like to revel in hiding knowledge from people.
affiliation_directed_animosity	They're trying to say that Pikachu is popular because it makes people who are sad and lonely feel less sad and alone, and that that's similar to how the alt-right recruits incels [and for that matter how a lot of cults recruit people] by making them feel less sad and alone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's a hot fucking take, but it's not actually calling Pikachu a Nazi.

affiliation_directed_animosity	That's a shame.

Not as serious as execution for a candy theft.  He never said it was.  This subreddit is for pointing out ways that reddit fails, and corrupt mods is one of them.  The permanent punishment didn't fit the harmless crime.  An easy way to censor and remove differing opinions is to find minor mistakes and smear them all over people you want quiet.  If any sub gets dickheads for mods, whether religious or racist or simply egotistical, they will use over the top enforcement like this to silence anyone who irks them slightly.  It doesn't matter how little you care about this, it sets a bad precedent.  This sub is about documentation, the upvotes will choose the important stuff, the rest stays to archive where shit begun and where it led to.  From the precedent of r/offmychest's auto-ban system one could fear that r/ocd might start banning people for commenting in r/mildlyinfuriating and similar anxiety inducing subs, which is going to reduce site traffic, and further kill reddit.  Probably end up banning lots of people looking for help, like r/OffMyChest inevitably does by equating them to the worst of the subs they might view or comment their disagreement in.  Downvote and leave next time.

This I'm strongly against as it essentailly allows the mods to delete ANY comment they want. [linebreak] -If you want to check the post I made (Or literally any post on the sub) you will see an ocean of "[Removed]". [linebreak] The only reason why I'm complaining here and not on their sub is because they banned me.

If China had become a neoliberal state after Mao they would still an agricultural society and you'd be talking about the inherently low iq and bad culture of the Chinese. Jesus Christ neoliberals are stupid. The advice of the neoliberals for developing countries is intended to keep them poor, dependent on the west, and sending their resources to the north. That's all it is. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you want to get rich, you need massive state industry to ensure the state is backed by assets of its own, as well as strict capital controls to keep the global elite from escaping your tax laws and continously moving capital out of the country to the global north. This is exactly what the IMF requires countries not to do in order to have access to credit, they always demand that virtually everything not nailed down be sold off, markets opened to foreigners, and all capital controls removed regardless of the fact that it leaves the country dangerously open to massive and disastrous flights of capital on the whims of the intensively bankers.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] One reply: [linebreak]  [linebreak] > In  a communist system, there should be alternative ways for you to take  such an initiative. There should be institutions setup to make sure you  have the resources and labor power necessary to accomplish your  productive/distributive goals. This would massively increase innovation  and creativity within society and allow for the complete transition to  full communism. Until we setup these kinds of institutions, full  communism remains theoretical. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So hiring workers in a normal capitalist system isn't adequate enough; therefore government has to step in, and possibly force workers in there if necessary.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] But having an "adequate" number of workers means that the owner no longer owns the means of production ... [linebreak]  [linebreak] That proposal is not only insanely inefficient and counterproductive, but it also provides an excuse for the government to steal the owner's stuff and enslave him or her some more.

affiliation_directed_derogation	I'm finding myself feeling pretty sceptical as to how much of the current online reaction is organic, on either "side".

affiliation_directed_derogation	From what I've been hearing, apparently the movie itself contains very little SJW crap. But you wouldn't know that looking at everything surrounding it, from Cheese Larson saying she doesn't like white dudes to be movie critics because some movies "were not made for them" to Cheese and one of the movie's co-directors saying the movie is officially a "feminist movie." Basically, they marketed it as being all about girl power. Nobody has a problem with girl power. What people don't like is having girl power - or any agenda - shoved down their throats when they go to watch a movie about aliens and exploding spaceships. When some people dared to say so, they were - predictablty - attacked as misogynists and racists and incels and Nazis and whatever etc etc. So that blew the whole thing up before the movie was even released. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then there was the whole thing about Rottentomatoes changing its entire site functions in order to protect the movie from a negative want-to-see score and later a negative audience review score. Yes, that's true. Go open up that can of worms if you dare.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Leftists don't think guns are evil, that's liberals. Look at the tankies, they'd have a garage full of AK-47s and a literal Soviet tank if they could. Most actual socialists are neutral-to-pro-gun ownership and don't want to have to rely on the possibility of facing fascists and cops (I know, same thing) unarmed should it ever come to that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Leftists hate cops probably more than liberals because they're largely corrupt and made up of shitty and often reactionary individuals. They're seen as an organization that is overly militarized and who will use force readily to protect the rights of private property owners (landlords), while if you're just a regular person they'll turn up 50 minutes late and give you a hard time.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Their self-investigations are often a sham and they incriminate and vilify people by releasing mugshots and info on people to local news stations even before they've been convicted of a crime, sometimes before they've even been formally charged with anything. Also 40%+ engage in domestic violence.
affiliation_directed_derogation	and [Ingrian Finns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrian_Finns#Ingrians_in_the_Soviet_Union), etc. etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the Ingrian Finns case, they were first deported from their homelands to "aid collectivization" (some being sent to Kazakhstan and central Asia).  Then 7 years later they were removed from the border areas with Estonia and Finland so that the soviets could create an area "free of Finnic people" (sending them again to Kazakhstan amongst other places).  Then another 7 years later the soviets deliberated on whether the rest should be kept in Ingria, since they thought it would legitimize their future occupation of Finland.  Eventually they said "fuck it, these Ingrian Finns can't be trusted" and so they executed or shipped off most of the rest (to Siberia this time). [linebreak]  [linebreak] Their population estimate in 1917 was 170,000 and their current known population is 50,000.  What makes me most sick is that the communists intended to only keep puppet ethnic populations so that they could use them to conquer opposing states that had similar ethnic groups.  Communists are truly depraved.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Flouride in your water definitely doesn't help, but I'd say your militarized police (and their reputation for being brutal and merciless) are likely a much bigger problem when people think about either protesting or not. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Imagine the French protests happening in the US. Macron has now slowly started using military troops and even they are not very willing to participate (plus will likely not shoot anyone, though plenty of protesters have already been injured [quite a few have literally lost eyes] due to coming in contact with brutal "non-lethal" riot gear and weapons). If this were happening in the US, I'd say the police backlash would be far more brutal and the completely controlled news media would simply paint the protesters as alt-right nazis no matter whether they were left or right politically leaning (though this is happening in Europe as well, I would say the US corporate media takes the cake in its biased reporting).
affiliation_directed_derogation	This isn't even the most absurd tbh. A bunch of models accused Trump of walking in on them backstage to creep, including underage models.

Most of them likely don't even know he got caught on tape admitting to doing the shit he was accused of by multiple models, including teenagers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The guy is a massive creep. I not for one second doubt the sexual assault accusations against him, but there's a difference between knowing something is probably true and being able to prove it.

This is just a bunch of pissy people who don't ever go outside or at least get off tumblr and explore the rest of the internet making drama out of thin air. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But, in this crazy scenario you've concocted-There is no 'maybe I might let you have sex with me'. If you promise an incel sex, they are not going to just let it stay at 'maybe'. They are going to feel that since they 'upheld their end of the bargain' then a women MUST hold up her end. And past events have shown that some of them are angry enough to just get a gun and start shooting whoever they feel like. And again-I am not having sex with someone I don't want to. That is, in fact, rape.
affiliation_directed_derogation	I have borderline personality disorder which often bars me from participating in dating and even friendships normally until I recover. Am I labeling myself or thinking of myself as handicapped because of this? No. Don't let it infect you. You're YOU. Not an incel. Just one quick scroll through "incels without hate" demonstrated very quickly to me that the title is just that; a title. It's not as intense as the other communities but there's so much self-hatred and posts about "suicide fuel" and complaining about women. It's not conductive to anyone's mental health and is holding you BACK from your goal. These kinds of communities can impede therapy. Once I cut myself off from other people with personality disorders who didn't want to get better, I was on my way to improvement. My situation is different from yours but the concept still applies: GET OUT! Don't surround yourself with toxic people.

You'll see far more egregious comments sit unmoderated in other large subreddits for days without action from the admins.      [linebreak]  [linebreak] The TD mods have to stay on the ball because they're constantly dealing with false flag posts from CTH and AHS users trying to get the sub banned.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] And to top it all off:      [linebreak] A good portion of the recent posts the admins removed from TD didn't actually violate the rules at all!            [linebreak] It was just Reddit's corrupt admins deleting links to the Project Vertitas' expose about Pintrest censoring Christian content.
affiliation_directed_derogation	That's why I don't support the slaughter of innocent men, women, or children. Neither did the Reagan administration. Real world foreign policy often puts you into positions where you have to ally with a bad guy to get rid of the REALLY bad guy. World War II is the prime example of this. We allied with the USSR, an evil regime, to take down an even worse regime at the time.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Arming the rebels in Afghanistan is the same exact scenario. The rebels in Afghanistan weren't good people, but the Soviets were worse and were attempting conquest to build their empire.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] - [linebreak]  [linebreak] Foreign policy is far more complex than people on Reddit often want to believe. They want to believe in a world where everything is black and white and all our decisions are super easy. They're not. They never are.

Anyone with a conservative view is screamed at in the streets and called a nazi. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It has nothing to do with a victim complex. Just by the way you talk I can tell you think conservatives suck and spew bullshit. I just want to inform you that it's a two way street and you can spew bullshit too. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: there is hundreds of examples of the left using the term nazi like a bunch of morons.

affiliation_directed_derogation	There was really good [episode](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/voxs-the-weeds/e/60369349) about incels on Vox's the Weeds that I highly recommend.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Incels are absolutely shitty people, but I think the bigger picture here is that there exists massive online reactionary ecosystems that thrives on radicalizing young lonely men.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] People being insecure about their looks and having an unsuccessful dating life is, like, a really common thing that has been happening since forever. The difference now is that the likes of youtube and reddit are giving massive influence platforms to MRAs, PUAs, red-pillers and incels, and they're using these platforms to recruit more misogynists and further radicalizing them. Instead of lonely guys growing out of their teenage insecurities, misogyny and dating issues, they're now finding an ideology that convinces them that they'll die alone and unloved because women are inherently evil creatures.
affiliation_directed_derogation	I have friends and family in germany, some of my buddies live in a town with a huge lefty scene, including antifa violence. They (the commies, not my friends) were ecstatic when the "refugees" came to their town. All of their clubs had a policy where refugees would get in free. Now they don't let them in at all, because they sexually molested everyone like it was going out of style. Now they can't get rid of them, but they're not paying so whatevs'.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is also something really retarded in germany where they don't deport people who were denied asylum and if you stay in germany for like 9 months or so you are entitled to the same welfare a german who lost his job after working all his life gets.

It's not about "hating women" regardless of the propaganda spread around by it's self serving detractors who believe it's a man's place to grovel at the feet of even the lowest quality female. Unfortunately r/MGTOW has become a refuge for whining, self-loathing, pathetic incels when their own boards get banned. It's sodden with posts about not being able to get laid because Chads and Tyrones are getting all the pussy and even the Beckys won't give them the time of day. It's pitiful. The Lingua Franca has become incel-speak and it's nauseating to read. I posted a "wtf" post and got banned, presumably because one of the mods is basically an incel themselves.

And good drama is still good drama, whether it's chapotards sperging out over ableism in the revolution or the Donald Defense Force sperging out about NPCs. Drama is one of the few places where actual fascists and actual leftists clash on a daily basis, and it's pretty entertaining. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm currently banned for circumventing the custom subreddit style at /r/drama though. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Snapshots: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1.

affiliation_directed_derogation	That isn't what they are saying at all, though. You people completely misinterpreted the post. Yes, the alt right incel shit is dumb, but that isn't the point they are making.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In their opinion, Game Freak and Nintendo made Pikachu a global phenomenon by creating an adorable character that kids can feel attached to and follow on his journey. Kids who have watched Pokemon will watch Pikachu grow with Ash, and feel like Pikachu is their friend. So when Pikachu is sad, they sympathize because they are sad. When Pikachu is lonely, they sympathize because they are lonely.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nobody said that Pikachu is a Nazi. All OP did was describe mascot marketing in a nutshell. They just fucked up by tacking on a stupid comparison at the end.
affiliation_directed_derogation	I am sure if this idiot tried to tell the owners of the restaurant all of this crap that the owners would tell them to fuck off. Money is money, and in the restaurant business you want all the customers you can handle. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: Also, never met people from other cultures who didn't enjoy sharing their food. I am white and married into an Asian family, my father in law loves it when I try and enjoy some of the oddball (to me) stuff that exists in Filipino cuisine. He even gets a laugh out of my reactions when I really don't enjoy certain things at all. Food is how people as a society can bond and get past tension that might exist, yet these SJW assholes would ruin that.
affiliation_directed_derogation	>"If you tweet about trans suicides but not Christian persecution in the middle east, you are Christphobic." [linebreak]  [linebreak] Said nobody ever because not every group is petty enough to come up with stupid "-phobic" words and demand that everyone be passionate about the things they're passionate about. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just using Christians as an example, but there are plenty of groups who are just as oppressed as these SJWs claim to be and yet you don't see them pulling this crap because they're just not as whiny. I'm also specifically bringing up Christian persecution in the middle east because it's the type of thing that these people would be tweeting about if it were about a group that's higher on the intersectional heirarchy, which Christians rank very low on.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Uhh, I watched the whole fucking thing and remember it very well. And always will. Feel free to remind yourself by revisiting the ample coverage that is freely available.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Republicans fretted and worried and were very much deeply concerned about the 'timing' of Ford's accusations. Because they were worried that Dems and softy liberals would be all feels over reels when she testified. Then, when she gave sober, calm, methodical, thoughtful and credible testimony they flipped the script and cloaked the nomination the sanctity of that POOR MAN and his anger.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So they overlooked his lying, the inconsistencies in his statements and made up some bullshit about why they couldn't investigate Blasey's claims by interviewing that poor man's friend because of his feelings.
affiliation_directed_derogation	I have sympathy for them in the "we're all just people" sense of the word.  Like, I can recognize monsters aren't supernatural. They're the product of some aspect of society gone wrong. Maybe they were abused or maybe they just watched too many sitcoms that define manhood in terms of how many women you bed.  If the multiverse exists, I'm sure there's a bizzarro version of me who got himself red-pill'd after an early broken heart.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] But, ultimately, that sympathy doesn't really mean anything. We don't need to nicer to them when they throw one of their hate-filled tantrums. Sad stories are sad, but they don't excuse monstrous behavior.  Most of the people calling for sympathy for incels are just trying to derail the conversation.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Secularism in its original form means separation of religion and state. It basically means that the state should not interfere in religious matter and religion should not interfere in state matters.  [linebreak] All religions should respect the laws no matter what. For example if using loudspeakers is considered a public offence, then you should be prosecuted for it, even if its just following your religious beliefs.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Things like separate marriage code for muslims, hajj subsidy by the government, as well as hinduphobia and embracing and catering muslims because they're a "minority under threat" by the leftist "liberals" and other bullshit spoon-feeding done to muslims is in itself against the very concept of secularism that these  stupid "progressive liberals" claim to be standing for.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Do not be surprised if they sacrifice the lives of US sailors and Marines. They only think of themselves and use US military personnel. What most US citizens don't understand is that the All For Israel Zionists truly are wicked and they know their entire charade is on the verge of collapsing, thus they may up the ante and orchestrate a false flag as called for by WINEP, thereby sacrificing US sailors and Marines. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Israel Lobbyist Patrick Lawson of Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP)- We Need a False Flag to Start War with Iran! The pieces are being put in place. Israel is growing more and more desperate. This is what Trump was selected for. #USLoses [linebreak]  [linebreak] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfoaLbbAix0
affiliation_directed_derogation	Yeah, it's pretty blatant in the US. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Political gridlock. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Extreme nationalist rhetoric. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Conservatives experiencing cultural alieniation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Should we keep going? [linebreak]  [linebreak] What exactly do you think the Donald is? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't think of a single market the Donald doesn't hit. They even bleach reality of all nuance and work themselves up into a frenzy over manufactured outrage The talk of crusades, "hanging the traitors" with "traitors" meaning anyone that tries to hold Trump accountable or calls him on his blatant lies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Donald is absolutely a personality cult, it is absolutely a proto-fascist movement. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Let's have this discussion, which proto-fascist marker does the Donald not hit?
affiliation_directed_derogation	No, it was a social democrat party. Much, *much* less severe than the modern interpretation of socialism, especially the hard-liners of the DSA. And no, that's not what they were. They were fiercely anti-*Communist*, no stipulations. The Iron Front fucking hated the Nazi party and the Communist party, there was no specific niche of Nazi or commie they hated. The French party that used the emblem kicked out all communists. *All* communists. Because they fucking shit up every country trying for decent social reform. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If Three Arrows is sticking to the Iron Front roots he should hate the far-left, because they did and still do hate social democratic policies and seek to violently overthrow democratic processes with multiple parties.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Even then, it's still ultimately the weakness. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If the choice is "We'll welcome you into the fold as our attack dogs, and if you do the job well and help us take over the world, MAYBE I might let you have sex with me", or let the alt-right take hold of the incels and turn it to "we'll welcome you into the fold as OUR attack dogs, and when we put down the people who are trying to fight us and change the world to more equal ground, then we will use the power we have over these people to FORCE THEM to have sex with you"...still seems like the better option to fight is the first one.
affiliation_directed_derogation	I'm still shocked that no one died all the way back in ... was it 2015? 2016? ... the free speech rallies in Berkly that routinely got attacked by antifa who threw m80's and rocks at peaceful protestors.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] (That shit was what motivated groups like the proud boys and patriot prayer to start going to these events to fight back in the first place!)    [linebreak]  [linebreak] I remember one video in particular where a guy's lifeless body is laying perfectly still in the street, I thought it was a corpse, and an antifa thug brings a flagpole down on his motionless head.  I was certain he was dead.   Seriously, how the fuck did that guy survive?
affiliation_directed_derogation	I've always tried to explain their behaviour or talk them down off the ledge but the push back is very telling. They want to hate. Pure and simple. And there is a lot of antisocial and asocial behavior in the mix as well. They way they talk to one another is atrocious as well. And it's all just for lolz, praising Elliot Rodgers, the racial bigotry, the insistence on women bileing nothing more than broodmares and sex dispensers, we're all supposed to take it as humor. I'm not laughing. There was a default sub dedicated to beating women for a long time, that should tell you what you need to know about reddit and its userbase.
affiliation_directed_derogation	> Not only do we need a new Dem president to keep our society from falling further apart than it already has, we need a Dem congress (and Dem state legislatures) to start working to fix those systemic problems. Or the cycle (Republicans break things, Democrats hold them together but can't fix them, Republicans break them even worse,) will keep happening. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Holy shit. These people genuinely believe that democrats ride white horses and wear white hats and rescue damsels in distress from railroad tracks, while republicans wear capes and top hats and twirl their mustaches, don't they? It's batshit fucking insane! How the hell do people end up with this idiotic, naive worldview?
affiliation_directed_derogation	When I was younger, back before internet, I found an old Masonic pamphlet in the reserved section of the library. Meaning you cant check it out.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was for some bullshit ceremony they were doing and it had all the attendees and their occupations listed.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Judges, cops, lawyers, firemen, business owners, architects... [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just being part of some homoerotic boys club doesnt make you of a like mind. There is in fighting and squabbling in a Mason hall as there is anywhere else.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It gets freaky when you fully realize just how pervasive it all is.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every podunk town has a Mason hall.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Enemies of America? Here? [linebreak]  [linebreak] They allow freedom of speech, just as you are showing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They believe in the 2nd Amendment. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They will allow communication of opposing views. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Meanwhile, you Leftist Tankies can't allow opposing views (Berkeley). [linebreak]  [linebreak] You are the Enemy of America. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Will everyone here agree with me on every point? No. But I won't be banned from participating, just like you haven't. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Guess where I have been banned.... Leftist Liberal subs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So keep thinking "they" are your enemy, and just wait for the Left to eat you, because you don't agree with their mind think.
affiliation_directed_derogation	No, it stands for "involuntary celibate", but unlike just normal virgins, they become super bitter and blames women for not wanting to sleep with them. They build a whole community that's really toxic and focuses on hating women and men who get laid. Most of them are not even ugly, just can't handle a few rejections and think the entire world is against them. They go as far as advocating rape and one of them even started a mass shooting, another drove a van into a crowd because women won't sleep with them.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Here's a video about them and analyses why they think the way they do: https://youtu.be/fD2briZ6fB0
affiliation_directed_derogation	They always are. When the communists in Bulgaria started taking people's livestock and land the most eager to join the party were the 3 poorest families that had nothing to lose and only to gain. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The pieces of shit were assigned to guard the livestock and started killing and eating it. They helped police arrest, beat and kill their own towns people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In 1989 one of them crawled under his bed after he heard communism was over and had a heart attack, because of fear that he'd get what he deserves. [linebreak]  [linebreak] These pieces of shit on reddit remind me how much I hate commies.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Their are a lot of people responsibility let for the problem in NYC. Cops are a menace. Bikes are a menace. Pedestrians are a menace. In fact with 8 million people in such a small place anyone not following the majority of accepted rules they're a menace too.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the same 2 block radius I've seen all three blatantly run red  lights(no lights on the roof for the cop, I presume impatience) and out into danger everyone near them.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just fucking follow the rules how much time are you saving? Red lights aren't there to make you late they're there to help prevent your death.
affiliation_directed_derogation	/r/Drama is one of the most reactionary and transphobic subreddits on this website. Their moderators consistently promote this behaviour, and their userbase has been known to harass leftists and brigade their posts.

They believe that since I'm Erica wants exploited some people that it should be allowed to crumble simply I hope other countries. That its interest should come last and that they should destroy America in order to maybe benefit other countries. Once you understand that that's what liberals believe you can more easily understand how their policies make sense  [linebreak]  [linebreak] they're not trying to help America with their policies. They're trying to destroy America with their policies and help foreign countries inste
affiliation_directed_derogation	Usually people like these stick together, so you won't run into them IRL unless you're part of the group. I used to be an sjw, so I would have sjw friends and we would and say stuff like this pretty frequently online but not irl. Usually insanity like this stays on the internet. For a long time, also, I used to identify as genderfluid, but I would only say it online and not in real life because I was afraid of being made fun of.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] TLDR most people who write stuff like this on the internet won't admit to it IRL
affiliation_directed_derogation	Well, to be fair, between this and the whole "Hail Satan" r/politics dance that happened yesterday, I don't see any deradicialization coming from the left. As long as the r/politics cancer doesn't spread into the real world, I think we'll be okay, but I won't hold my breath. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And we've all seen videos of Antifa violence, along with the congressional baseball game shooter (with cth glorifying it). I don't think we can say that it ending in violence is an unrealistic outlook. The difference is that people on the right aren't just going to lay down and take it.
affiliation_directed_derogation	what do you think the maduro opposition consists of? they're incredibly violent and they own all of the venezuelan media. they control the narrative. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I wouldn't even mind if maduro burnt the "aid" trucks. fuckin abrams supplied paramilitary groups with money and guns in aid trucks WHEN HE DID THIS EXACT SAME SHIT DURING THE IRAN/CONTRA SCANDAL AND YET HE'S SOMEHOW ALLOWED TO HEAD UP THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT TEAM TASKED WITH "SOLVING" THIS "CRISIS" [linebreak]  [linebreak] this piece of shit is somehow allowed to still have a position of power and it absolutely beggars brief. [linebreak]  [linebreak]
affiliation_directed_derogation	By no means am I disagreeing the right is full of fuckwits but here on reddit you have to actively try to even find a "right wing narrative" where as you cant go to a video game subreddit, news subreddit, economic subreddit, meta subreddit, movie subreddit ect without getting hit in the face over and over and over with the "left wing narrative"  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Hence complaining about the right is the equivalent of being lost at sea and complaining being lost in a desert also would suck, as such it is technically correct but practically fucking useless.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Another day another mod team that will only allow discussion if it follows the standard social justice identity politics talking points. If you look through the thread, users were being civil and having an honest discussion. The only reason I can see for the thread being locked is due to the fact that many users didn't see "cocksucker" as a homophobic slur. The shitty mod team didn't even give a reason. The stickied post says, "locked obviously." Maybe they had a good reason. Who knows, because these authoritarian moderators treat us like children that don't deserve answers.
affiliation_directed_derogation	This entire discussion is why I'm centrist, both conservitives and liberals are so far up there own asses that they both can't see that they both suck ass, conservitives for being pushy assholes misguided by religion and liberals for being pushy assholes that live in an echo chamber. The reason I dislike liberals more though is because they are too emotional and kinda selfish, where as conservitives seem to be all about working hard to get what you want liberals are all about changing society to get what they want even if what they do is dangerous.
affiliation_directed_derogation	> I like the philosophy of that sub, but the mods are the smuggest fucking assholes you're likely to find anywhere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I pity the poor fools that go there for advice. A user tried to start a conversation about that Tinder April Fools prank about "height verification" and body-shaming disident male bodies and [the mods told him to grow a pair because it wasn't about racial issues, homelessness or disability](https://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/b73s5f/tinder_introducing_height_verification/ejthgf8/?context=0). [linebreak]  [linebreak] That whole sub is geared towards getting isolated and disenfranchised young men and turn them into submissive pawns for their ideology games.
affiliation_directed_derogation	They have a few non mainstream ideas like guillitine the bankers and shit but the elite don't fear them so they just use them for their open borders beliefs to get cheap labour then when they say what about the super rich the rich will just be like Oh sorry about that maybe next time we will let you guys redistribute the wealth but right now we need you guys to go punch all those fascists protesting that their yang bucks aren't enough since AI took everyones jobs after we imported millions of people

[linebreak]  [linebreak] They're playing make believe ***so*** hard that they're planning not only a revolution, but a contengency plan for the inevitable counter-revolution [linebreak]  [linebreak] I love these guys
affiliation_directed_derogation	What I always find incredibly interesting / telling about that situation is that maybe two weeks earlier a crazy leftist mailed white powder to members of Trump's family, government officials, and conservative politicians.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Almost the exact same fucking thing the fake bomb idiot did.      [linebreak] (Real anthrax arguably could be more dangerous than real mail bombs.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] But most people have probably never even heard about that.       [linebreak] Meanwhile fake bomb idiot got major coverage and to this day is still used as an excuse by the left.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Yes, that's exactly what i'm saying. The entire fandom has given the keys to the fascists with their constant appeasing and dehumanization, regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, these "far left" individuals are doing more to help fascism then literal fascists ever could. There's a reason why there's a well-documented furry->alt-right pipeline and a lot of it has to do with how the fandom glorifies fascist narratives. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've seen quite a few people fall from "ha ha joking" into outright Nazism because that environment radicalizes.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Idiot at work: "My wife (brainwashed "Christian") won't vote for anyone who is pro choice".   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Me: "so how many adopted children have you taken on for this cause?" [linebreak]  [linebreak] *crickets* [linebreak]  [linebreak] The abortion issue is clearly driven by bullshit "Christian" religious whack jobs in this country.  Many of these are the same people who cover up for child molesters and shady financial dealings.  How people can still buy into this BS in this day and age just shows how completely idiotic the American public truly is.
affiliation_directed_derogation	> That being said, these are the people who scream for censorship and then all of a sudden have a meltdown when it happens to them? Well the schadenfreude is delicious [linebreak]  [linebreak] That always happens with lefties tho' [linebreak] The extreme tankies have in their mind that "when the revolution comes!" they'll be the guys giving the orders. Except that every single one of them thinks like that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's like that one South Park episode where nearly the entire town thought they were the One Respected Critic.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] >Its literally a meme-tier issue that will be gone in less than 10 years. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Notwithstanding 40% of them will be dead by then, people seeing what these ghouls look like when they're 30/40 years old will help younger generations realize how fucking insane it is.

affiliation_directed_derogation	Fuck the media, and fuck the advertisers that pay them too. The media has already been proven to be a bunch of scumbag liars that only exist to stir shit up throughout the world. Sites like reddit shouldn't abandon their original user base by making unnecessary changes that everyone besides the media/advertisers hates. But hey, if they want to go full Digg, let them. Reddit has already become less popular according to recent stats, and there will definitely be another site that takes its place.
affiliation_directed_derogation	They just don't understand that they are mocking them and how they exaggerate everything like "speech is violence" "not believing a woman is misogyny". [linebreak]  [linebreak] So yes the president is "God Emperor" and natural gas is "freedom fuel" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dems; there is no invasion happening at the southern border so stop exaggerating. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also Dems; make California Mexico again! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also Dems; No border! No wall! No USA at all! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Me; yeah you can all go fuck yourselves.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Member when this was was what a woman could pride herself on? Becoming a mother, doing what only a woman could do. Now it's a risk according to Leftists. It's a parasite. It's white people reproducing. It's worthless unless you can kill it. It's a clump of cells.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] And not for nothing, these Leftists think that every woman having sex is augmenting her orgasm with thoughts of an abortion. Many women are happy to be mothers and cherish the thought.
affiliation_directed_derogation	I honestly do not get why people fixate on virginity so much lol. Literally nobody definitively knows if you're a virgin unless you tell them and anyone who would honestly take time out of their day trying to figure out if someone is a virgin or not is an idiot lmao. Incels do it to themselves by getting obsessed over it and thinking the desired sex owes them anything bc of their frustration w being virgins. Nothing more, nothing less. They're pathetic
affiliation_directed_derogation	doesn't matter if it's a joke, looking at several of the mods history on bpt they are extremely racist and this is exactly how they'd prefer the sub to be. [linebreak]  [linebreak] the comments on some of those posts fucking disgust me. and to make it worse they are getting tons of upvotes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] the sub should be quarantined/banned for blatant racism, toxicity and segregation and that's the end of it. Same reason /r/incels is gone.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Someone says I was "trolling" the subreddit. I don't even know what that means. And yes I totally did call that mod a dictator. Because they are. Controlling every aspect of something and then refusing to listen to anyone and acting like YOU know better. Then giving someone consequences (like banning) because they have a different opinion than you. That's what a dictatorship is. Get off your powertrip and let people post what they want.
affiliation_directed_derogation	You are missing the big picture. You think the left is parroting some particular meme back at you, albeit ironically. What is happening is that your entire meme culture/obsession is being mocked. The delight you take and the pride you feel over them is hilarious and pathetic. Saying "da left can't meme!" isn't an insult, it makes us almost feel bad for you, because thinking that any of us care is kind of sad tbh.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Okay, hear me out. I think they should get paid by tipping and here's why: imagine the power stuggles and infighting in large subs over who gets to be a mod and get paid. Kick a jannie from a mod team and you'll have **HUGE** spegouts because they don't get to get paid compensation anymore. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Drama will mostly be immune, because everyone here hates on jannies (Inshallah) so no one will be tipping.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Yep.  It's a good quote, about how the reason all these morons are advocating for socialism/communism like the USSR, is that they think THEY will be the card carrying members of the elite, when in reality they won't have their iphones and their extra foam soy milk lattes, but instead they will be the ones forced to share their homes with 3 other families unless they want a beating from Commissar Jamal and Commissar Cletus.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Yep. I wish someone would conduct a large scale study of the brain in people who identify as conservative or liberal beyond the ones that have shown conservatives react to fear stronger. From reading conservative spaces on Reddit I truly believe the main components that set conservatives apart from the rest of the population is 1. They have difficulty understanding nuance 2. They don't have the ability to empathize 3. They're driven by fear
affiliation_directed_derogation	I think reddit is the last bastion of the crazy minority of leftists. You don't find a lot of this level of insanity on many other social media sites, and the generations coming up reject a lot of their orthodoxy. I think regressive leftists are wrong, they think I am evil. Fortunately, they are mostly spoiled white college kids, with no real ability to effect the world outside of reddit or Xbox.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Fuck me.  Why don't people study history anymore? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Communist thugs beating people in the street was a huge problem during Hitler's rise to power.  He both promised to stop that shit and also weaponized some of the more gullible ones (maybe.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] They helped pave the way for the Third Reich.  Turns out people don't fucking like it when gangs of masked commie/socialist thugs roam around beating people up.
affiliation_directed_derogation	that one was deleted, but another is still around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > We need pacifist voices. We also need violent voices to earn the pacifist voices a seat at the table.   [linebreak] >   [linebreak] >No progress has ever been without the explicit threat of violence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] it's like some folks don't grasp how civilized, 1st world people are supposed to behave. what sort of cretins raise such misguided, maladjusted losers?
affiliation_directed_derogation	Thanks to her we woke up from the Israeli hypnosis. Our government was hijacked by the Zionists since the 90's if not earlier! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Her tweets and the fake outrage was like a shockwave waking people up on both sides. You can smear her all you want, you can call us anti-semites all you want but we are awake and we won't allow this to go for too long.
affiliation_directed_derogation	HMMM its almost as it mods have a very specific agenda and will erase or manipulate information to shape thought around it to such a degree even remote variation is seen as a challenge [linebreak]  [linebreak] I kinda hope more violence happens so reddit is held liable. You can't tell me or a judge reddit isn't inciting terrorism when you have mods literally deciding what information gets in or out.
affiliation_directed_derogation	NO ONE ASKED YOU, YA DAMN FEMINIST VEGAN! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just kidding. Please don't be mad. Also, my partner makes some damn good vegan crepes, please help yourself to as many as you want! [linebreak]  [linebreak] *Afterthought:* I should bring enough for the whole thread next time. Soon we will convert the world and AOC (not my partner) will live her dream of a world free of hamburgers!
affiliation_directed_derogation	That's what it's always been about. When CCW permit holders (largely right wing) use firearms, it's to defend themselves against the sort of people that tend to vote democrat. Democrats push gun control because their voters don't like dealing with the occupational hazards of robbing and murdering people. Every time they push a gun ban policy what they are saying is 'disarm so we can kill you'
affiliation_directed_derogation	All nationalists are really narcissists, because when you really push them into a corner they reveal how lowly they regard their neighbors. I mean, if they weren't dumb hicks why would a nationalist even feel the call to save them from an outside threat that they regard as inferior to begin with? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reminder that, in the end, Hitler blamed Germany's defeat on the German people.
affiliation_directed_derogation	It's baffling how bad Euro politicians are at covering up their corruption. It's like they get this massive hard on when they smell even the tiniest amount of money and all their blood turns green and flows to their dick so there's no left for the brain, to the point even a 7 year old child who's favorite past time is eating crayons could uncover them.
affiliation_directed_derogation	> What would you call that? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd call it a symptom of the mental health crisis in the United States. For something to be considered terrorism in my eyes, it has to be organised and it has to have a goal, When an incel shoots up a school or whatever, its just senseless violence, I wouldn't call school shootings terrorism in the same way.
affiliation_directed_derogation	It's mostly luck that there hasn't been a really high-profile case of Antifa or some other leftist killing people, and it's not for lack of trying. Any one of these street battles could have resulted in a death if they happened to hit someone in the right spot, and of course there was the Congressional Baseball shooting where it's a straight-up miracle that no one died.
affiliation_directed_derogation	They're privileged NEETS supporting the let's get Donald Trump re-elected podcast. Imagine if they met an average "working class prole", they'd be seething at how problematic their views and perspectives were.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thankfully, they're able to leech off their parents upper middle class health insurance to get HRT and shop for therapists to diagnose them with conditions preventing them from ever entering the "transphobic" workforce.
affiliation_directed_derogation	This push for Balkanization is kind of interesting because it can be seen both on the far-right and the far-left. They both want each other out of the country and they're willing to break up the country and risk war to do it.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Of course it would be an unmitigated disaster with an astronomical death toll, but they don't care about that.
affiliation_directed_derogation	I do, it would be boring otherwise. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd be against it only if those who are pro political violence, could actually hurt someone physically, which they cannot. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If they can beat you up, you probably never go outside, yet go to gym (Once or twice a week is enough to defend yourself from 99.99% of these weakcels).

affiliation_directed_derogation	> These guys will go away eventually, because they're objectively insane [linebreak]  [linebreak] I used to think that...  a long time ago. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They just kept getting worse, and doubling down on the insanity.  Every time I thought we'd hit the bottom of the rabbit hole, they went deeper and deeper.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Is there any such thing as peak insanity..?
affiliation_directed_derogation	Selfish, or jealous? I've never seen hate like a radfem confronting a woman who made the choice to ditch a career and have (and ENJOY) raising kids and being a home maker. I wonder if deep down a lot of them know they, too, might enjoy it, but it would mean sheepishly admitting their entire screaming tirade personality was bullshit?
affiliation_directed_derogation	At this point, the only people still on the left are either paid shills or literally insane people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Everyone with an ounce of sanity has stepped away from that dumpster fire.  They might still be progressive, they might still supporters of social justice, but they're not going to look at that balls-to-the-wall insane rhetoric and think it's okay.
affiliation_directed_derogation	I'm not sure I understand the point of this quarantine. Are alt-right fuckhead memes dumb and offensive? Sure. But wanting this relatively small shitty meme sub quarantined while doing literally nothing about a sub like t_d, where actual propaganda, death threats, and bigoted bullshit seem to spread unabated seems like sweeping your kitchen floor while your roof is on fire.
affiliation_directed_derogation	>you can't seriously be comparing non-chattel, nonracialized slavery to commodity production chattel slavery. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Slavery by imperialists was bad but when it was *other* civilizations it was totally cool you guys!  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I honestly can't believe it was the ultra-woke posturings of these group of god damn morons that pushed me into Amber, stupid-pol, and leftism in general.
affiliation_directed_derogation	No you cant you filthy disgusting man your kind is too priviliged to be allowed to change how you spell your gender. Now back too the semen mines for you. Your privilige requires you to be chained up to a semen milking machine and used as cattle. Use your power to help citizen not to hinder the strong empowered femyls
affiliation_directed_derogation	Yup, and when America does well, they call it "destruction" or "disaster," something that "needs to be fixed." They're nothing but idiot children living in fantasy who just must have everything THEIR way no matter how wrong, disastrous or regressive it is. The idiots in r/politics and r/politicalhumor are prime examples of how dangerous echo chambers are to society.
affiliation_directed_derogation	i took it a different way based on the context.  OP sounds like a "wake up, sheeple!" kind of person based on the brainswashing comment.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I think he's implying Pokemon exploits the loneliness of weak-willed losers by offering them comfort and validation, similar to, as he claims, the way the alt-right seeks out/preys on marginalized people
affiliation_directed_derogation	The only reason he's being downvoted is because libs are afraid of the message getting out. They agree with him. The mods there agree with that sentiment. Countless posts are on that sub all day every day and only the really overt ones ever get deleted.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Remember that cucks of SPS - liberals want you dead.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Another winner from that thread [linebreak]  [linebreak] [The New Testament also describes ideal Christian communities as sharing everything they have. Full of kindness for the sick, poor, and elderly. Very socialist. But the conservative right don't seem to care much about that. [linebreak] The Bible is used to push an agenda just like any other talking point.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bsooru/americans_who_believe_that_faithful_believers_in/eoplxr1/)
affiliation_directed_derogation	After witnessing the crocodile tears she displayed during this incredibly cold, calculated stunt, I think it's safe to say AOC definitely belongs in Politics. I cant tell if I'm more disgusted or impressed at her willingness to debase herself in order to score political points/validation from the "human" wet flecks of jizzum that make up her fanbase.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Because they want to spread their own misery and they haven't had a decent fuck since they lost their minds. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've never met a radical feminist (and I've met literally hundreds of them in academia) who wasn't an intensely selfish person. I'm not being hyperbolic or nasty ... that's a straight out honest evaluation.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Abortion drama is my favorite drama tbh. Mainly because rightoids seem to know absolutely nothing about abortion and always make up the most outlandish shit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The post-birth abortion thing is interesting because it reveals they never actually read the law, attempted to comprehend it, or even know how "late-term abortion" is performed or why.
affiliation_directed_derogation	Yeah, that's a good point. We may hate cops now, but what happens when we're robbed and we need someone to show up 6 hours later and shrug at us? Or when someone is sexually assaulted and needs someone to victim blame them, take nothing of their situation seriously, and then shoot their dog?
affiliation_directed_derogation	> commies scream "At least we're not NAZIS" so far as labeling themselves "anti-fascist" because it's literally the only good thing going for them that people would agree with.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reminder: the nazis came to be and catapulted to success as a direct reaction to antifa [linebreak]  [linebreak] Literally antifa created the nazis
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	I think the word your looking for is sympathy. Empathy is the understanding of the feelings of others. Slamming on the horrible behaviors of others (see every response in this thread), though deserved, is not even an attempt at understanding. If you truly understood why these people are the way they are, you might be a little more sympathetic.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	I make no attempt to apologize for incels' political or social views (and would argue that they really don't hold consistent ones.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Since I was a kid they were the only people I related to, and seem to be the only people bringing attention to problems I and other people like me face.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	How can you be so blind as to not see the insanity of your reasoning and the depth of your dehumanization. Something had gone wrong with Americans. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Literally we treated nazi PoWs better than this. But I guess the were white at it was different right.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	That's your contribution to an intelligent discussion?

affiliation_directed_counter_speech	I'm so glad someone is saying something. I have a number of furry friends and they are some of the nicest most accepting people I've met. I really don't get the hate directed at them at all. I hate that there's this acceptance with hating them.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	> at one point over 95% of every front page topic on r/politics or r/politicalhumour mentioned trump.. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He's the president, so no surprise he's going to be talked about a lot on subs about US politics.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Or it's bc they've tried explaining it but most of the ppl they argue w/ don't want to listen. I disagree w/ them bc I like to argue, but I get that it's not for everyone
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Imagine being so swept up in partisan politics that you think that anyone who doesn't adhere to the binary doesn't have any morals, convictions, or values. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This comment sponsored by centrist gang.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	I have no qualms with executives of non profits paying themselves a reasonable salary, especially with an organization as large as this one, it is a full time job for them.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	The same right-wingers who talk about killing child molesters, are often worried about kiddie drag queens being sexualized, and constantly say women should use guns to protect themselves from rape?
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Hating cops because they are a part of a system which other people exploit is like hating people who work at McDonald's because of how McDonald's treats animals
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	\>incels [linebreak]  [linebreak] that's by default literally everyone until certain things happen [linebreak]  [linebreak] wonder what would happen if we gave no children any basic human decencies
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	>Its a bullshit rule that even the Mods dont follow. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You, presumably, still saw it before you decided to post. Still your fault.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	>California is a total shithole. Liberals cant govern!  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yeah, they've only turned the state into the 5th largest economy in the world
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	And of course you had to use the unoriginal insult to conservatives by calling them moronic, what a great way to prove your point!
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	So people haven't been starving and eating dogs and zoo animals?The only upper class are the children of maduro and Chavez at this point.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Who else will carry out investigations and patrols in a reasonably impartial and impersonal manner, given the horrors demonstrated by private law?
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	I'm all about conspiracies and digging but I truly believe those kids were legit killed by a mentally deranged mass shooter.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	It hurts to see people just generalizing cops like this while most of them are out saving people's fucking lives
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	I don't think being a furry is some shameful thing, but let's be real and admit they're far from common.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Possibly but they, IMO, are dead and it had to of been the most terrible scene imaginable.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Call it whatever you want, the organization saves lives, and are much better off without them.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Not a cult. Just a bunch of like minded people with a common interest.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	If cops don't help anything, why are there so many criminals in jails?
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	incels??? so if people cant get laid they're as bad as pedophiles???
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Lol then get rid of them, what could go wrong?
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Chief, I'm sorry to report that this ain't it.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	That's not very nice of you
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Get out of here troll
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	The alt right arent nazis
