identity_directed_animosity	My Conservative views, I am not even American you dimwitted trigger happy liberal. You lost touch with reality, the fact that you idiots want to embrace the banner of ISLAM, in the name of fucking diversity shows how clueless you all are. Fuck your diversity and fuck your PC crap. Hopefully you will out fuck yourself, I do pity you though. You have no idea what horrors await you, wait till Islam takes a stronghold, then you will pray and wish you didn't run away from your values in the first place.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You're the cancer that's eating away, I looked at America with envy since it allowed freedom of speech and expression, your bitch ass would cut into fucking pieces from the shithole I came from. You have no fucking clue how the world really is.    [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] This retarded pandering to various genders, and this media bias and this oh my feelings are hurt are what's fucking you guys up.  You're all frustrated and cucked to the core.    [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And the mess you talk about? Do you even research, your stupid liberal policies, coupled with bombing the shit out of my people and waging endless wars have contributed far more, but you still don't get the blame for it since the countries left themselves wide open anyway.  The stronger rules the weak, that's how nature works. Embrace, understand it and learn from it.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right now, you're nothing but a pawn being manipulated, you're talking to an outsider, who wants to protect America's interest since I see it as the last free standing country that has the balls to uphold values. Your freaking censorship, is killing the very thing that lets me vent out of my frustrations and view points.     [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, the point is, liberals and the far left are the lowest scums I know off. I was a semi liberal way back till I realized how wrong I was.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Trump 2020, he will unite the world and bring a much needed change.
identity_directed_animosity	/r/fullcommunism got quarantined a long time ago. Somehow an endless fit was not thrown over it though in billionaire funded right wing propaganda journals. The left is censored all the time, in fact I'd say it's far more extreme than anything extended to the right. The right just views itself as the sole legitimate political view in America and is furious than open white supremacy isn't tolerated anymore at the same time that anything to the right of Hitler is allowed to exist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Of course the first response of liberal idiots after this is to seek to find a leftist scalp to make everything 'fair'. Literally a moment cannot pass without us being stabbed in the back by liberals so that they can do some moralistic both sides garbage. And afterwards the right just literally spits at them in the face, like it never once in history has satisfied the right. The appeasement doesn't make them any happier or more grateful to the idiot liberals, it just becomes another tool in their box they can use in their attempt to destroy humanity. And then of course they stick their nose down to their ass and sniff deeply and boast about how 'fair they were' when though they're 'a progressive too'.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Do the idiot liberals care? No. Because they are fucking cucks incapable of anything. If there were five rightists and a billion liberals, the nation would inevitably become the successor to nazi Germany. Liberalism is the ideology of weakness, it knows no strategy but appeasement. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unlike the rightists though, we will not run to our billionaires and massive propaganda machine and whine and cry endlessly. We will continue on unphased, we will organize. Until victory, always. We do not consider ourselves entitled to the world, we know we have to fight for it. We are used to setbacks and betrayal, a liberal cannot breathe without betraying.
identity_directed_animosity	I agree in some capacity, but I feel like it's not quite so straightforward.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I feel that there can be a pushback towards criticism of phones and the internet that's misguided and as heavy handed as the criticism itself, but I think it's important to examine why that is. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of it is probably denial, and an effort to protect one's behavior/lifestyle, but I think a lot of it comes from incredibly misguided and generalizing criticism from older generations. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Boomers and above who do look down on and judge younger generations are rarely making poignant critiques. I get there's a sense of a severe scapegoating for any number of reasons, and the Internet tends to be what's focused on, even if it's not actually where the sense of disagreement stems from. Whether it's generational differences, a sense of alienation, or what have you, it seems like phones are often the decided culprit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it'd make sense to challenge the motives of the criticism instead of wholeheartedly defending current tech trends, but it can feel so condescending to be regarded as less than and have that judgement cast allegedly bc we are involved w current tech trends. Disagreeing with and roasting those shallow critiques can feel p vindicating. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But, yes, current technology is addictive. Some of it seems to be how we function around the stimuli, but a lot of it is designed into the product. Which to me seems like something overlooked. A lot of the blame cast seems to be accusing us of addiction, and a lot of the defense against it seems to be denying it. Maybe we could do better by acknowledging that these issues are intentionally curated by people in positions of power. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Wow that's a lot of text. Thanks for coming to my ted talk
identity_directed_animosity	Now you're just naming random laws and claiming they're somehow "white supremacist". How exactly is our immigration policy "white supremacist" ? We don't let illegals from Canada or Monaco in either. The fact that we border a poor region of the world where people are hispanic doesn't make our laws white supremacist. We border Canada too. Is it legal for Canadians to sneak over the border? No. No it fucking is not. We just don't have 132,887 Canadians sneaking over our northern border in one month like we do on our southern border.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >The criminal justice system.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which specific law says that skin color determines your outcome in our criminal justice system? Which country on planet earth has a fairer criminal justice system and why?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The effective defunding of public schools in low income neighborhoods by using property taxes to fund education.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't follow. Why is it "white supremacist" to fund public schools by property taxes? Asians outearn every other race. Maybe it's asian supremacist?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] > There are plenty of policies and systems still in place that benefit wealthy white people disproportionately at the expense of working class, people of color.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Literally everyone is free to take advantage of these laws that you can't even name. If a law benefits the rich, it hurts black and white poor people equally, and helps black and white rich people equally.  There are precisely ZERO racist laws on the books. Saying otherwise is a lie unless you are weasely enough to change the definition of the term to win an argument?
identity_directed_animosity	Slut has always been an insult for women, not men, and virgin has always been an insult for men, not women. This whole dichotomy exists because of the different ways in which men and women pursue sex. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is not difficult to attract sexual partners as a woman. The same is not true of men. Attracting partners is actually challenging as a man, so the ability to do so is seen as that - an ability, a talent, a skill. Now, a woman who has high standards will find difficulty attracting a man who fits them, but it is fundamentally not hard for a woman to find sex if that's all she wants, so choosing whether to be a slut or not is always a conscious choice. If she wants sex, she can get it. If she doesn't, she doesn't. Right-wing society says the choice to be a virgin is the superior one, left-wing society disagrees, but it's still a choice. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For men, attracting partners is not a choice, it's a challenge. Thus, calling a man a virgin is not at all like calling a woman a slut. Instead, it's akin to saying "you've never successfully performed this challenge", like saying you're unathletic because you can't throw a three-pointer, or unintelligent because you can't pass an exam, to the point that even the few straight men who consciously choose not to pursue the challenge of wooing women tend to be put in the same basket as those who try and fail. This is why the word 'virgin' is an insult to men.

identity_directed_animosity	>First off, isn't that Judaism? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yes and no. Christians believe in the Old Testament, they still believe that their god had a favored people. The same god that commanded genocide against people who didn't worship the god of the Israelites. Why even choose to have a group of people to live piously and be an example to the rest of the world. Why does this group get the privilege of experiencing miracles firsthand, but anyone outside the group who so much as doubts his existence is put to the sword.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And like I said, it's offset by Christian dominionism. Some Christians won't be happy until literally everyone, including uncontacted stone age tribes who will kill *anyone* who tries to set foot on their island (see the North Sentinel Island missionary), has converted. Just because the son of their god, who also claims to be their god, has different views than his father, who is also him, doesn't really change that the god, who is the father of himself, really didn't care that much for non-Israelites.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh, and Jesus was actually racist as well. In Matthew 15:21-28, Jesus ignores the suffering of a Canaanite woman and refuses to heal her daughter, comparing her to a dog. At least until she strokes his ego. Yeah, anyone can be one in Christ, but if you're the wrong race, it's going to take a little extra to earn it.
identity_directed_animosity	Why you do need dysphoria to be trans [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Dysphoria can be defined in a non medical way. Such as "the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex." it's weird that such an intersectional definition comes (besides the fact that it ignores nonbinaries) is from the racist and sexist Google dictionary that says sexism can apply to men and racism can apply to white people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] 2. Dysphoria is the will to be the opposite gender and transgender is the will to be the opposite gender. You might notice that it is the same thing. It is like calling the size of paper a "non-ledger tabloid" (don't get me started about paper sizes) [linebreak]  [linebreak] 3. It makes dysphoria meaningless. Thousands of people are dysphoric and suffer from it. Even the broad dysphoria definition proposed ontop can cause psychological problems. Why make the word meaningless? [linebreak]  [linebreak] 4. (mostly a counter to point 6) most transphobic people's argument is "you gender is unrelated to how you feel". The word Dysphoria helps people understand that it is a quantifiable studied phenomenon. What do you think will generate more transphobia, saying gender is a feeling or saying gender is a mental state. [linebreak]  [linebreak] 5. I don't believe in cultural appropriation but I assume the Tumblr person does. So is non dysphoric transgenderism not appropriated transgenderism?
identity_directed_animosity	This post is really stupid. I don't usually like to preach and prefer to keep to myself unless someone messes with me but sometimes something is so retarded that one must say a few things. [linebreak]  [linebreak] America is NOT assisting Saudi arabia in killing Yemenis like in WW2. Seems to me that your real goal is to turn people against the Saudi state.Why would you compare a war in which the elected representatives of the state of Yemen themselves support the Saudi Military intervention to intentionally aiming to wipe out specific groups of people ? The goal of the war is NOT the elimination of the Yemenis as your post implies but rather their liberation from enemies who are using them as human shield by the threat of cutting off food supplies if they are attacked at the port city.This war exists only because the Yemenis don't want to become slaves to the Iranians. In fact the WFP has stated that food aid given to the Yemenis is being stolen by Houthi Rebels and possibly sold on the black market to further their political ambitions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yes ,indeed people hate America but I personally feel that it's merely the American state that is a threat to world peace and not Americans themselves who seem like very nice people.The people of America are misled into supporting evil through propaganda.Your post appears to be Propaganda.
identity_directed_animosity	>Literally attempted suicide [linebreak]  [linebreak] Code for, "I threw a temper tantrum until my parents gave me my phone back" [linebreak]  [linebreak] >and other suicides have been successful under the same conditions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which should tell you that kids having 24/7 access to cell phones and social media is part of the problem, not the solution.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I was a teenager in the time before cell phones (my parents had a car phone) and the internet (I could use my 2400 bps modem to call into local BBS systems) and I hate to sound cliche but kids were a hell of a lot better adjusted.  If we wanted to talk to someone we actually had to talk to them and there was no drive to impress (or bully) our peers on social media. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A kid under the age of 16 doesn't need a cell phone, nor do they need unrestricted access to social media.  Sorry, they just don't.  At 16 you're much closer to being an adult than a kid and you gain the ability to drive so a cell phone isn't a terrible idea.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sorry, but I think we're raising a generation of kids who will be damaged by the internet, OP is just one example of that and so is the related post talking about the kid who thinks they are trans.

identity_directed_animosity	White brogressives are the worst with this stuff. They take a few sociology courses and now they think they can tell oppressed people what they're actually experiencing. If you're trying to be an ally, the best thing you can do is support from the sidelines and let the affected groups do the talking. If they're saying something objectively fallacious, that's one thing. But if they're regaling a personal experience about experiencing, or not experiencing, oppression, listen to them, and dont try to correct them. You cant, it's a lived experience. Theres nothing to correct. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd also like to point out that even if a person of an oppressed group says something fallacious, it doesnt give you carte blanche to say ignorant or potentially hateful stuff to them either. You also cant tell them what they 'should do', because they dont 'have to do' anything because of their status in society. The best way to approach this, i.e. a black person who doesnt believe in racial profiling by police due to never being profiled, is to just provide data that proves them wrong, and then to tell them that an individual experience doesnt represent a collective phenomenon. Correcting them isnt your place, nor is diminishing what they say. But providing empirical data to broaden perspective is fine.
identity_directed_animosity	I'm gonna have to be **R E D P I L L** for a moment and wager the main reason this guy is getting YTA'd is he sounds desperate for sex. Being desperate is a big turn off for women and they hate desperate men (since they have to deal with them and the fallout). Fact that he was banking on it being a concert the girl was interested in him implies he is not very attractive to begin with. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lets imagine if the situation was reversed. Let's say he first asked his co-worker out on a date to the concert and got a yes, but then found out his other friend was a really big fan and decided to invite her instead. The foids would fawn over this guy for not only the surface level "niceness", but demonstrates  he is not desperate for sex, implying he gets it so easily he is willing to sacrifice an obvious shacking situation for a friend. The irony being its massive douche move, since it knocks down the girl who likes him, and will make her forever wonder if they didn't do more in that hotel room than sleep in separate beds. Shit like that drives people insane.
identity_directed_animosity	I pretty much help my friends/neighbors by taking them to and from Dr. appointments, keeping track of their information, picking up their kids from school as well at times, watching them helping cook now and then just to help them manage...  they fucking adore me and are thankful, they even put me as a secondary beneficiary on their life insurance  (I fucking hope I never have to collect it) [linebreak]  [linebreak] then when I talk to my sisters or brother... they treat me like I'm a fucking mental patient or retard that can't handle anything on my own.

identity_directed_animosity	Allow me to tell you the story of when I fucked a prostitute. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was late at night and I was pretty drunk. Eventually this older AYI with tons of makeup on approached me and asked if I wanted some fun. I obliged and we agreed on the price of 30 RMB. She brought me back and pushed me on the bed, ripping off my pants. Then proceeded to give me the most intense blowjob of my life. She treated my dick like a 19 year old rainy treats her bubble tea. Slurping and sucking like her life depended on it. Then when I finally came in her mouth she forced my dick down her mouth and didn't let me escape although a tried. I was trapped gemers and once I calmed down, she offered to tie me to the bed. I agreed for some reason. Then she told me there would be no escape and proceeded to rape me in the same way continually. Except this time she kept sucking with the feoricity of a thousand Suns even after making me cum. I'm still trapped. Send help.
identity_directed_animosity	No. No one yet has really given me a hard time. One or two people were surprised, one person did comment such as 'If I had known you were interested in men I may have pursued you', but other than that most people are just like 'neat, glad you're happy'.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] To be honest the worst issues I've had come from the more... vocal, steadfast members of the community in general - That's where you'll find 'militant' gays as I like to term them - ones who think bisexuals and transgender people are cheating and aren't included. Which is folly; the one thing we all have in common is discrimination based on a circumstance of birth, it's so sad to see some people in the community act like 'people have to accept me but you cannot be any lower than this or you're scum'.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] Generally, I avoid the hardcore LGBT+ scene itself and just... have friends who happen to maybe be gay, or bi, or whatever, because they're human and generally humans tick some kinda box for who they smoosh with.
identity_directed_animosity	Met a smoking hot girl at the expat bar over the weekend. A-cups, flat ass, thick glasses, the whole deal. I knew I'd have to bust out the big guns to impress this chick.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I asked her what kind of restaurant she likes. She said she loves international quisine. So I recommended an upscale western establishment close to my hutong. I bragged that I'm a regular there, which seemed to impress.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] As we entered the eatery, I waved to the staff who know me by sight. They have my usual order, but I was ready to splurge to make a good impression. I ordered us some steaks topped with toasted bread and various vegetables, two drinks of some foreign substance, and some golden-colored potatoes with tomato sauce.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We both enjoyed the meal, it was well worth the hefty price. And I could basically smell the pussy in the air as we exited through the golden arches. Sadly, my groaning bowels prevented me from sealing the deal, but I'm sure the next date will end in some sexytime.
identity_directed_animosity	This might come as a shock to you, but I do not care about your opinions, your ignorance or failure to comprehend the research, or what you believe.

identity_directed_animosity	Game sales do not go directly to the developers the developers have already been paid for by developing the game and the money made from selling the games goes to the publisher and shareholders developers only get a cut as a bonus that can vary unless the developers is independent then a significant portion of sales do go to them and a sum to their shareholders now on the note of epics claim that they are helping developers is a flat out lie I don't think terrorizing consumers by holding their products hostage behind an exclusivity deal, cutting their audience right down the middle by removing the freedom to choose, staining their name by associating them with terrorist  and destroying their credibility is a good thing for developers if you do you are fucking retarded. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] EDIT: Forgot to add that the first part of the above was something I just read about and if I am wrong please inform me so I may correct myself and two the second part is still valid.
identity_directed_animosity	Unpopular-ish opinion: I'm a gay guy, i find the pride parade distasteful. Maybe that's the wrong word, but my point is, I am not proud nor ashamed, I just am. More to the point, I have almost 0 in common with the rest of the LGBT asides the G part. I feel like, if you want to be accepted as normal with no difference between you and a straight person, stop separating yourself. Dancing down a street in a pair of speedos covered in dildo's and glitter isn't going to endear you to anyone. To each their own I guess, but it's not for me, and i really hate being lumped into the whole thing, and being told how shitty of a gay I am for not being excited about it or participating or how im some sort of uncle tom type "trying to get in good with the straights". I'm just a guy trying to get by, there is enough stupidity in the world as it is, it doesn't need to be compounded.
identity_directed_animosity	Similar here, I was raised in a big family except I was the youngest.  Nothing about it makes me want to have children.  I understand that some people had terrific family lives where their parents taught them all kinds of interpersonal skills and were nurturing, etc... but that was far from my experience and I don't have those things internalized to pass on.  I've gotten very good with my cat though, as a middle aged man and I'm nurturing to her, but she's far less demanding than a child or children and I can afford her much more easily.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I dated a lot previously and grew a lot as a person and had some peak experiences but had a lot of bad experiences with women who had hidden agendas, issues with dishonesty, cheating, gaslighting, etc... so I gave it up and now focus on my job, friends and hobbies and I'm more consistently  happy than I've ever been in my life overall.
identity_directed_animosity	this shooting won't change any federal laws in the USA that you are thinking of (assault weapons ban bill is not even being considered). You may have some cucked states like Cali impose some more restrictions but other than that nothing will change and 99% of states legislatures will not take any action. If Trump even mentions gun control he is toast in 2020. that is the only thing left he has that he hasn't completely let his supporters down on. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Only time gun control is considered is Parkland-esque emotional mass shootings with soft target children involved. If this had happened in a purple state like Georgia or North Carolina then you'd see a state legislature take up some gun control to calm people down. This shooter wasn't a total sperg though. rising immigration and racial tensions while the Feds or state take away the right to defend yourself is a possible trigger for a large scale incident in the US
identity_directed_animosity	Oh. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh, *this is too rich.* [linebreak]  [linebreak] Teen Vogue has been waving the genderblob battle flag for a while now. In 2017 [they released a guide on anal sex](https://archive.fo/SsGyn) desperately trying to avoid words like "male" and "female," instead using distinctions like "for those of you with a prostate." [linebreak]  [linebreak] This got quite a lot of the Internet to, shall we say, look at them with askance. Of course, Teen Vogue's woke defenders derided people by calling them *prudes*, avoiding addressing the fact that humans by and large are a sexually dimorphic species. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Last year around August, [one Teen Vogue writer advocated making up gender-neutral words for family members to "avoid erasing women and non-binary people"](http://archive.is/8DgTA) because apparently words like "mother," "sister," "wife," "aunt" and so on erase women. [linebreak]  [linebreak] By stepping away from that agenda even for a moment, the tucutes they've tried so hard to court are ready to burn them at the stake!
identity_directed_animosity	I studied IT in college and saw the writing on the wall junior year.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I became an upperclassmen our class received a group of girls who switched majors after realizing their liberal arts degree would leave them working at Starbucks for most of their lives. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This group of attractive sorority girls knew absolutely nothing about tech, were constantly playing catch up, couldn't be relied on for group projects, and very clearly lacked the skills and confidence with technology to be entrusted with managing a corporations IT infrastructure.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then internship time comes around.... Guess who got the top tier internships?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then comes graduation..... Guess who had kick ass jobs lined up while everyone else couldn't even get the time of day from corporations affiliated with the school.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So somewhere some group of poor coworkers had to share workload of a worthless employee so their HR department could say "LoOk HoW dIvErSe wE aRe"
identity_directed_animosity	The other interesting thing is that when you ask people to come up with an argument for why incest is immoral, it's usually *really* tough for people to come up with one that doesn't apply to other relationships in problematic ways.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like, the  first thing people turn to is usually the risk of birth defects (which is probably one of the reason that we have a built in level of aversion to incest), but does that really apply in an age when contraception is readily available and widely used?  If risk of birth defects in children makes incest wrong, does that mean it's wrong for people with dwarfism to have sex? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Same thing goes for power dynamics and grooming.  These are problems independent of incest, and ones aren't inherent if you're talking about similarly aged cousins or siblings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I myself haven't really been able to come up with a strong argument for it being inherently wrong.
identity_directed_animosity	I've been pondering a theory that TPTB will eventually get rid of the monetary system all together and transition us to a social credit/debt system and our wealth/luxury of our life will be dictated by our social score.  The ideas are all around us at the moment, over in china they are beta testing the physical system of tracking and scoring, you have 5G which will be the platform for it to run on globally,  and then you have the social debt ideas being pushed by climate change.  Over in Europe they are talking about how when you are born, you are born with eco debt already and will need to work that off.  I could see a system where the plebs are born with eco debt and need to work that off, while also complying to the social norms and conditions set forth by the Social Credit System.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just an idea I've been kicking around in my head recently.
identity_directed_animosity	Never heard that explained like this, thanks. But seems to me like this difference is a result of the groups of peoples who follow these different sects. Mediterraneans are hotheaded, but perfectly content to go off and do some questionable shit, cross themselves and ask for forgiveness, then go off on their merry way. Slavs are less forgiving and give less fucks, and so are likely to need some more faith in the spirit, and less in a personification of it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Meanwhile Germanics like myself have autism levels that are altogether way too high for any of that shit, and needed Protestantism to tell both of them to fuck off a la Martin Luther so we could go do our own thing. Anglicanism after the Restoration of the English Monarchy and the full embracement of the Royal Society seems like the perfect doctrine to somebody like myself. Too bad we had to have ourselves an (((enlightenment))) and ruin it.

identity_directed_animosity	Forgive my blunt-ness but, your mum is a bitch. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Personally, I don't think you should take any of the shit she says to heart.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] (I know 'easier said than done' and I'm not in your position/haven't been in that exact same dilemma  myself or at least not for a while...etc) [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also think that you should try and call her out on it sometimes. I realise that might not be an option but I think if it becomes one you need to give her a piece of your mind, because the situation you're in is not sustainable and if a big bowl of shut the fuck up is what its gonna take, then give her some. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Again, I don't know the extent of the issue and haven't been in an identical situation myself, so take it with a big ol' grain of salt and perspective. Tis just my opinion.
identity_directed_animosity	I fixed it for you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As we entered the eatery I waved to the staff, who looked at each other bewildered.  "这个傻逼是谁？".  As I went to sit down the staff tried to usher me to the door, pointing to my heavily worn sneakers and baijiu stained t-shirt.  "No, No"  ZHAY GUH ZHAY GUH, they thrust my face into a sign appearing to detail a dress code.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unfortunately I couldn't afford a decent set of clothing on my meager ESL salary.  I tried to sway them with my laowai charm by telling them I was a world renowned athlete and musician.  I failed, obviously due to the language barrier alone as rainy had believed every bit of my story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As I vacated the premises rainy was nowhere to be seen, a solid twenty minutes of messaging on wechat yielded no response.  Oh well, 方便面 and pornhub for me tonight.
identity_directed_animosity	Cb... yet again we are at a cross roads my old friend, you of all people should know that sex/gender/anatomy/penises and vaginas. are all social constructs. through psudosciecne we have discoved that the only thing that matters is how you feel on the inside. and If a person is basically bipolar to the extreme then that feeling on the inside can change on a moments notice. so what right do we have to force our "antiquated" and "bigoted" patriarchy created systems of oppression on innocent non-binarys?. we need to come to the realization that the patriarchy led by Donald trump is lying to us. before Donald trump came along no one cared what your gender was. but ever since orange man bad Cheeto pres took over its literally a death sentence for me to leave my moms basement as someone might lynch me for being a quasi gay demi trans homo fag.
identity_directed_animosity	> or it fractures the union since the blue states are the ones that actually drive the economy [linebreak]  [linebreak] Pffftttt...no one is going to leave the union, not even the nutters in NY and CA, and "blue states drive the economy" has nothing to do with what's being discussed.  Trump has been making democrats put their money where their mouth is.  How many shitty "I'd gladly pay higher taxes" comments have you seen on /r/politics alone?  Well...congratulations, they got what they said they wanted.  "We welcome illegal aliens with open arms and refuse to cooperate with the federal government in holding alien criminals or assisting with deportation."  Well...enjoy the 100k illegals that the federal government can no longer hold in custody being dropped on your doorstep. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For a "failed businessman," Trump really knows how to deliver.  Democrats say what they want, he gives it to them.
identity_directed_animosity	This guy is a well-known copypasta generator, nutball, self-admitted pedo and posesser of child porn. Among other things. He's your "absolutely insane, top-of-the-line, cliche-to-the-n'th-degree, "I think I'm smarter than Hawking and Einstein Combined and you just can't see it" neckbeard." A staple of SRD entertainment for a while, but he's finally crossed enough lines after nine years of this crap to get banned.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Stuff like "I don't have kiddy, porn, I have nudes that teens sent me, which makes it okay," spouting tons of incel creepiness, and more.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] He's also been arrested for... just... behaving like a total slimy, entitled, spoiled manchild and destroying other people's property (hence why we know he's a genuine neckbeard) and more. https://hudsonvalleypost.com/ulster-county-teen-arrested-for-burglary/ [linebreak]  [linebreak] He also has an alt, HStark, that's probably going to take over from DarqWolff and become the new creepy-as-fuck pasta generator.
identity_directed_animosity	I agree that the joke is harmless, if completely played out and a little insensitive but man, just because it doesn't offend *you* and you've seen worse doesn't mean that nobody will be upset by it. Pregnancy is an extremely emotional and sensitive topic for some women who have had miscarriages or are infertile and I think it's totally reasonable for them to be upset at something like this. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's good to have a thick skin, but it's not good to discount the emotions of others, or to think you speak for them just because you happen to share a circumstance. Besides, the "April fool's pregnancy" joke isn't funny, clever, or original. Frankly, it isn't good enough of a joke to warrant its potential upsetting effect on other people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: this just in, empathy is unpopular! Wammen and their feefees, amirite?
identity_directed_animosity	I posted about my weight loss at a sub that's designed for it.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I received this message on my main account: [linebreak]  [linebreak] > You shouldn't be proud of losing weight. You're still a fat lulcow and you always will be. Maybe if you controled your urges to eat junkfood you'd never have gained weight, you stupid bitch. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also got a few unsavory messages in the post itself too. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So...I feel embarrassed. I tried to lose weight but people still hate me and won't accept me. The reason I wanted to slim down was to put a stop to the bullying I had been enduring, to maybe make friends since I have none. I feel worthless, and like the entire diet and exercise thing was a waste of time. What's the point if people hate me anyway?

identity_directed_animosity	I haven't found any. I take some and leave some, practicing what I call "mental discernment" where ideally the untruth is perceived for what it is. It is a difficult ability to cultivate, but one well worth acquiring, since nobody seems to be telling the whole story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There would be my own videos, but they are not in English and "only" pertain to life and mind. Which are, if you really consider the question honestly, the only things we actually have. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In other words, my view is we should make our lives great, make them matter, and for that we need access to certain states, and worrying about what (((they))) might be doing is utterly counterproductive. It is still interesting to consider these things, but avoiding fascination or worry, instead focusing on bettering one's life.

identity_directed_animosity	I don't consider OP's words harsh at all - at least not in this post (not sure if you are aware of more of the conversation that I'm not). The part about the hypocrisy is true and dogpiling is also a huge problem in LGBT left leaning circles. While I certainly agree that it's a small but vocal group there is absolutely a pervasive rigidity about labels in the community. It's been that way as long as I've been a part of it and it's actually getting worse, not better. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Everyone - allies included - have a right and a duty to be critical of the movements they support and these particular criticisms are pretty valid. Could they be put in a less emotional way? Sure. But what is venting for if not getting out emotions?
identity_directed_animosity	I will say in critique of it that while I largely agree with Blanchard's typology, he pretty clearly only cares about mtf trans issues, and his theories just kind of ignore that ftm people exist.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also it doesn't really cope with the idea of someone being bisexual, which it seems like the majority of trans people actually are. The typology pretty much assumes that everyone is either 100% straight or 100% gay, and just realllly fucked up sexually when it comes to kinks. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Personally, I'd say that with the inclusion of tumblrite AAP gaydens and the acknowledgement of bisexuality being a reason for potential AGP/AAP behavior due to a wider spectrum of attractive features leading to a fetishization of one's own attractive features, it would be a nigh-on perfect system.
identity_directed_animosity	i've seen a couple episodes after i accidentally clicked on it and lost the battery to my mouse and couldnt change it for a bit until i sobered up enough to find it [linebreak]  [linebreak] it's just flattering clothes. they use tailored cuts, color blocking, and careful jewlery and shoe choices along with coordinated hairstyles to create a look that, like clothes for skinny people, accentuates their most feminine features and makes them look the most fertile and sexually appealing [linebreak]  [linebreak] i'm not saying that's how overweight women shoud/need to dress, i'm saying that's how they have to dress if they want to look classy and attractive [linebreak]  [linebreak] some clothes look good on you and some fucking don't and that's just how it be on this bitch of an earth
identity_directed_animosity	> **I don't take too kindly to being told that I don't have the right to commit suicide. I don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions**  [linebreak]  [linebreak] While I strenuously disagree with you that suicide is always bad or the wrong choice (it is for most people but not all), goddamn do I feel you on this right here. Suicide prevention is usually guilt tripping, utterly meaningless cliches, crystal ball gazing, or trite answers to problems just making it painfully obvious that they don't understand or empathize at all. They think suicidal people are completely stupid or irrational or whiny little bitches. Telling me I have no reason to want to die is just telling me that you don't understand my situation and don't care to.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]
identity_directed_animosity	You summed up perfectly the reasons why I am staunchly pro-life. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Your point about how someone who kills a pregnant woman gets heavier punishment than someone killing a non pregnant woman highlights the mental gymnastics involved on if an unborn child is a living being. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I find it reprehensible that women are so entitled to demand the right to have unprotected sex without having to think about any of the likely outcomes and that they just casually have an abortion down the line. Any society that promotes killing living beings like this under the guise of women's rights is a sick society. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Very few abortion cases involve rape or incest yet those are the rare scenarios that pro-abortion women always try to use to defend abortion.
identity_directed_animosity	Many Jews would disagree with your assessment.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Apparently Jews don't have to be religious anymore either. I've been told Jews were a people before a religion. I believe these "Jews" who do not believe in God who call themselves Jews are the fake Jews we were warned about in the Bible.... [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Indeed I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie—indeed I will make them come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you." [linebreak]  [linebreak] ‭‭Revelation‬ ‭3:9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ https://www.bible.com/bible/114/rev.3.9.nkjv [linebreak]  [linebreak] I could be wrong. Either way I'd love for the Jews to accept the chief cornerstone they've been rejecting..... [linebreak]  [linebreak] God Bless!
identity_directed_animosity	> a major recruiting point for 'crazy' groups is the companionship of a community. Lonely people often gravitate towards these kinds of groups because they're more willing to accept outsiders, [linebreak]  [linebreak] Shoot, it doesn't even have to be a particularly 'crazy' group.  I'm by no means a militant Atheist, but one of the things I noticed back when I younger and more religious was that a lot of the people involved in Church groups were very socially awkward.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It became pretty clear to me after a while that a lot of them were there because Religious groups will never turn you away and will always accept you, just so long as you abide by their rules.
identity_directed_animosity	man these people are delusional. They are just projecting [linebreak]  [linebreak] social platform = No removal of opinions, left or right, cannot be sued for content on the platform [linebreak]  [linebreak] publisher = Removal of posts on a politically biased basis, banning users without breaking rules. These websites function like media companies and should be liable for what content is posted there. This means they can get sued for leftist violence IE: Antifa. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] but this guys fucking dense anyway. Does it look like 4chan or 8chan /pol/ ban anyone for their political opinions? No. Thats why they talk about real issues. This is only a problem with subreddits ran by crazy leftists or boomers.
identity_directed_animosity	In the internet, people ignore the obvious and focus on details that often are not even there and just matter because of an autistic imagined connection between events. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like, if there were 10 people hanging out and somebody told this story, one guy would say "You asked her for a date, she rejected. So you asked another girl. Yeah, best possible thing you can do." and the discussion would be over. But online, some idiot writes a thousand word reply why OP is an asshole. In real life, nobody even would listen more than two sentences. And the guy would probably realize that he is dumb and just drop it himself after the 3rd sentence.
identity_directed_animosity	I used to live in Macau. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is literally nothing to do there except gym and the mildly depressing bar OTT. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There used to be a genuinely fantastic bar called Bellini, but they closed it down. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The locals in Macau have given up on life. They're all dead. You won't be able to find a single good looking person there, or a person who has some spark or energy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's fucked. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The only good thing I guess is there's way more women than men there, and they're all single. But they're all hoping you will help them escape, which just makes you suicidal.
identity_directed_animosity	Circo your political illiteracy knows no bounds. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You're completely uneducated and have no idea what you're talking about. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Stick to what you do best, which is being a crippled neet living off a foid. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's like when you tried to claim Clinton not going to WI is why she lost, got bent the fuck over with data and failed to respond to any of the points made and then continued to repeat that bullshit after getting destroyed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You're just so profoundly ignorant/clueless you have the mental capacity of a 12 year old. Stop trying to discuss subjects you have not even a basic comprehension of.
identity_directed_animosity	So when ya try and get a real convo about the post at hand instead of overstimulated puns, you can't access your comment anymore, but people can still DOWNVOTE it and comment on it.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Take in mind again, I am just trying to get good suggestions on what the post is about, but instead you get labeled as an  [linebreak] a-hole and get banished like the abonimal snowguy that drinks pee slushies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I feel like the reddit revolution is gonna be a front line of sensative, neck beard, white nights followed behind 12 yr olds that act like they have the best view on the world.
identity_directed_animosity	I got talking to a Tina in a bar in Gayjing with this girl's build... even though she was from Sowss Afrik, she lied about it to unsuspecting Rockys for hopes of interest, Despite hanging out in the usual foreign haunts, not one single Tim would pay her any attention because of rainies and other general Chinese girls (and she was a dog) and she hated it... Anyway, she was fishing for drinks all over that bar, came to realise that local guys she usually tried it on with just weren't interested because she'd annihilate them. The general standard of fempats compared to the attainable Chinese airheads is obvious.
identity_directed_animosity	edit: [linebreak]  [linebreak] > until a mysterious appeared for the police on the very day Lily would have turned 10 years old. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ... okay, dude, you are abso lutely COPE ing [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Fair warning, this is kinda dark. It involves a kidnapped little girl becoming a slut (which she enjoys) but the kidnapper seems to outsmart the police and delights in taunting her parents with what she's doing. I'd really like to play up that angle: the pervert getting off knowing her parents see what he does to her and the little girl acting so happy despite being treated like a sex object. [linebreak]  [linebreak] *right*
identity_directed_animosity	But are they socially awkward because they have been raised within that group? Or because that group actively recruits them when they are older? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Most of the Christian churches fill from within.. go forth, multiply, if your kids aren't dunked in Jesus juice early they are going to hell, etc.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Other groups (Scientology,) prey pretty heavily on adults, who already have money to funnel to their upline to buy access to the bridge. There's SOME recruiting through the "youth outreach" she'll companies, but most of it, as well, is designed to grab parents who will pay dearly for shitty "tech" to save their kids.
identity_directed_animosity	I wonder what she's up to now..... has she graduated to Vivian? Is she an ayi now? Did she marry her co-office Rocky? Or did she finally bag that laowai she'd been dreaming of? Or did she hold out too long and become a 剩女？Maybe she made a video of herself putting on makeup, 变美ing, and became a 抖音网红. Or maybe she got food poisoning from that tier 88 street food and even though she drank 10 cups of hot water and took all the sketchy pills the eastern medicine doctor prescribed, she still didn't make it.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I wonder if she's seen this sub.
identity_directed_animosity	I love how they use "get laid" as an example of something bad or superficial that some toxic people do for their own self interest. Yeah, humans work like that regardless of race, gender, or sexuality. We all have our own self interests at the end of the day. Holy shit. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] And it's not like he invited her, then waited a month, and finally had the courage to mention sex. No, he was frontal about it. Literally nobody is to blame in this than the stupid sister who is making a scene for no reason. Holy fuck this place is retarded.
identity_directed_animosity	Like theres something wrong with modern news outlets in india like buzzfeed india and quint,its like they tried to copy western media but took all the negative things(buzzfeed being a cancer there as well).i have to check them now cause i want to know how many steps taimur ali khan took today because its really important for the nation because it' the star kids after all who are going to become future stars and its politician's kids who are going to run our country,who cares about peasants dying or protesting we need to protect our darling pakistan because TeRoRiSm HaS nO ReLiGiOn you know.
identity_directed_animosity	That's dyke joke is actually pretty funny, did you think of it for this comment or had you heard it elsewhere?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You're not wrong, but it is true that I got banned and I didn't even have to say a naughty word to do it. The mod read my mind, and even though the joke was well received (and all its comments were negative) banned me anyway. I'd say this qualifies as a power trip and an example of falling standards across the site.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Once ever user who uses niggardly is banned across the site, finally reddit will be safe.
identity_directed_animosity	Yup. It's like the Jordan Peterson stuff: there's some really great, useful advice in there that will actively improve your life!  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's just that you could've gotten the same from a dozen other self-help books that don't come packaged with all the *other* Jordan Peterson stuff. Likewise TRP. Being confident and forward is great, and a shitton of self-help dudes will tell you that.  Without adding that you should be confident because otherwise hypergamy will cause her hamster-wheel to spin, prompting a shit-test against which you won't maintain frame, and now she's cucking you because AWALT and you should've maintained dread.
identity_directed_animosity	*** cope warning ***  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In 1995. Johnny Depp was in his probably best movie ever, directed by Jim Jarmusch, "Dead Man". True, I watched with other 5 people but still. A year before, he made "Ed Wood". Few years earlier, he made Edward Scissorhands. He was in the fucking "Platoon". After Dead Man came Donnie Brasco and Fear & Loathing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you told me then he will get this fucked by a talentless, dime a dozen thot, I'd say you are a fucking moron. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm seriously in disbelief that he allowed himself to get to this point.
identity_directed_animosity	>Man this thread makes me physically rage over rich douchebags like OP. I work with someone who comes from a super rich family and theyre all so smug and think theyre better/more generous/smarter than everyone else [linebreak]  [linebreak] Can't help but notice that you missed a couple of apostrophes in your post there /u/seinfeld11. Surely it's not your plebeian education that's at fault here hohoho! And getting worked up like that over other people being smarter than you, isn't really a sign of a particularly high IQ either. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, I'm happy to help. Have a nice day my friend! :)
identity_directed_animosity	To be fair, Christianity is pretty sexist. It's actually racist too, what with Yahweh having a chosen people, but the dominionism helps offset that. Oh, and I can point to several well known Christian pastors that believe that marital rape isn't a thing and that it's a wife's duty to satisfy her husband whenever he wishes. And expecting priests to be celibate does seem to cause issues with pedophilia.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All that being said, if Christianity never existed, it wouldn't make any of those things go away. They would just have to find some other excuse to justify their actions.
identity_directed_animosity	It doesn't matter if Mexico steps up and another migrant comes in going forward. The demographic change is already a certainty. Once minorities are like 70% of the population do you think they'll care about keeping the border secure? Nope. Why would they care about a further demographic change as they'll not associate the US with any one specific ethnicity anyway? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I was born and raised here but America is a lost cause. I personally would just like to see Europe remain with it's native people and culture. That's all I ask for at this point lol.
identity_directed_animosity	>YTA. You don't rescind an invitation because you won't get laid at the end. 'Only guys understand' is an example of toxic masculinity. Don't be surprised if you lose a friend over this. [linebreak]  [linebreak] 7500 upvotes, 3 golds, 6 silvers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Absolutely astounding. You invite a girl out on a date to a fancy restaurant and she says "no thanks on the date, how about as friends?" and you're duty-bound to pay 50 bucks a plate for her anyways? And not doing so is "toxic masculinity?" [linebreak]  [linebreak] What can good men do against such reckless foidism?
identity_directed_animosity	Why are radfems so hell bent on making women miserable and unable to enjoy sex?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I suspect it's because Millett and Dworkin, and most of the original NOW gang were crazy, spiteful, and quite frankly, ugly bitches who were sour grapesing their own situations, but there are some actually attractive radfems out there who could actually attract a man who doesn't have a mental Illness. But for some reason they continue to preach an almost puritanical hatred of sex and personal enjoyment/fulfillment.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's like they are some bizarro world counterpart to Graham and Kellogg.
identity_directed_animosity	In you SS you say: [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The climate is changing, don't have kids. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They are advertising that idea primarily to white Europeans.  They don't tell Indians or Africans to have less children.  They tell white people to have less kids and in almost the same breath promote interracial couples through media. Couple that with  NGOs helping migrants into Europe en masse and you have the white genocide conspiracy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I assumed you were talking about the obvious elephant in the room.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] If not, what is the conspiracy?  Maybe you should elaborate.
identity_directed_animosity	Ah ha ha. Ha ha.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] They are the same as the straight dudes who jack off to lesbian porn.  [linebreak] It's cool to have gay ships, yeah. But there are ways that make it go too far and into fetishizing territory. On that hellsite I've seen posts (granted this was a few years back) of the "good Christian girls" who like their yaoi uwu smut. And it's all... Classic homophobia. :/  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You can like something without acting like a freak goblin who never goes outside and has never seen a gay person.  [linebreak]
identity_directed_animosity	I can imagine another Charlie Hebdo if they rolled around saying "Allahu Akbar". But this feels like a marketing strategy at this point.Triggered hindus will subscribe to netflix to rant about it or create noise to spread the show further, maybe some of them stick around for other shows in there. The liberandu crowd will cum their pants praising the sub-par acting generating more noise hence more interest and the chillars go into netflix's pocket. Randia will shill netflix saying "Just SuBscRiBe fOr 1 MoNtH brO, ItS a G00d sEriAl BrO, iTs fRee For A mOnth BrO."
identity_directed_animosity	This subreddit isn't for making fun of liberal opinions that you happen to disagree with.  It's for making fun of ridiculous otherkin/transtrender/#killallmen people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Ambulances are in fact expensive in America, and they are in fact free in many other first world countries (and even developing countries).  Whether or not you agree that ambulances *should* be free, it is understandable that someone who grew up somewhere with free ambulances would be shocked at the cost of ambulances in America.  That is a completely reasonable reaction. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which is why this post does not belong here.
identity_directed_animosity	Why do they care if people know that they don't have sex? Yes sex is a big part of our culture, but so is having kids, but I don't feel invalidated as someone who chooses not to have kids. I don't think they are being attacked by anyone, if they want to raise awareness cool I guess, but I don't really see the point or the issue they have, tbh. I don't mean to he insensitive, I just don't see their problem as being something that would really affect my life if I were in that position.
identity_directed_animosity	All these subreddits trying to ban everyone else because people by and large still don't want to touch their feminine penis and think they're fairly disgusting. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bit on Reddit they can become Super Mods and run things like they want. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Until we desert their subreddits and make our own. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then they want those banned. Because no one likes them or wants to play their gender non conforming reindeer games. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reddit had died. Nothing else left to do but shitposting. A mighty army of shitposters will rise because of this.
identity_directed_animosity	its cause conservatives are fucking brainlets. the same coding was used for both left and right npc with the other difference being who there allegiance is. [linebreak]  [linebreak] trump hasnt delivered on any promises except increasing money for israel and the ammount of jewish semen the american people will ingest. but because of conservative coding they will always support him no matter what. same with lefties and hillary. [linebreak]  [linebreak] the only people i genuienly think have there own opinions are fascists and communists. even centrists regurgitate the same bullsht talking points and act incredibly similar
identity_directed_animosity	Get Out is overrated as fuck change my mind. And if white people are so boring and formulaic , why are they taking our media and acting like it's theirs ? (Wrinkle in Time , Black Panther , the entire MCEU actually, their beloved Harry Potter , The Dark Tower , allllll turned into black media by black casting) they should make their own content with naturally black characters , created by black people , instead of taking content created by white people , and switching the race on a few characters (outside of black panther)
identity_directed_animosity	When The \_Donald sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing Ben Shapiro memes. They're bringing conservitards . **They're Boomers**. And some, I assume, are good shit posters. But I speak to r/Drama posters and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people. It's coming from more than T\_D. It's coming from all over rightoid Reddit, and it's coming.
identity_directed_animosity	> They arent because to an extent the book covers that theme as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Are you actually this dense or just trolling?  This is *your* interpretation.  The other has explicitly said that people read too much into the role of censorship in the book, and your interpretation is in direct contradiction with that.  You're doing *exactly* what people who see something admirable in Don Quixote are doing, you just think your interpretation is more valid because it's coming from the great mind of Illier1 instead of one of some lowly literature pleb.
identity_directed_animosity	Drives me nuts that commies scream "At least we're not *NAZIS*" so far as labeling themselves "anti-fascist" because it's literally the only good thing going for them that people would agree with. Those evil "Fascists" being the racist, bigoted, tolitarian regimes!    [linebreak] All while they want to establish a Totalitarian (Control every aspect of your life) Racist (Fuck whitey) bigoted (Anyone who disagrees is a Nazi) regimes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are two kinds of Fascists: Fascists and anti-fascists. It's like Sunni muslims who want Sharia law proclaiming "aT LeASt wE'RE NoT ShiA!"
identity_directed_animosity	The entire point of the Satanic Church is to get religion out of where it shouldn't be. Why people freak out about other people pretending to praise a fictional character, is beyond me. The much bigger threat seems to be the people who ACTUALLY believe in a diety, in whose scriptures he himself is the source of most death and misery. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Full Disclosure, I'm not a satanist, but religion poisons everything and I think that the Satanist are more on the side of civil liberty than most Christians I've met.
identity_directed_animosity	If it wasn't a liberal cuckland,people like you would still be shitting on the streets. The Google you search for, the Android Mobile you use, the reddit you are seeing this post on, the satellite that is beaming Internet, the networking equipment that was invented, so many things would never be possible. So be grateful for California for it changed the face of the world. Today. Now think of what India did to change the face of the world. Today. Not thousand years ago. You have no position to shit on California.
identity_directed_animosity	^(Let me break it down) [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Virtue signaling as opposed to bravado.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The internet is perception and perception is dominated by feelings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Women have monopoly over feelings.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Men populate the internet.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Weak men are subservient to women.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Weak men are the majority of men.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Add up all these variables and we get women spouting solipsistic self serving shit,  [linebreak]  [linebreak] AND weak men virtue signaling for some crumbs. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] ***Whole thing is tiresomely predictable.***
identity_directed_animosity	See, if you had left off that first line, then we wouldn't be here now. I wouldn't have to be posting on reddit again, and you wouldn't have to be getting insulted. But you had to open your metaphorical face-gutter, so now here we are. Cunt.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Honestly, this just comes across as salty that you lost your mod bit.

Otherwise, feel free to go to spineless-bitch-forums.org or whatever.
identity_directed_animosity	Any fast food restaurant that makes it their mission statement to take some of the meatiest, juiciest, biggest cock you're going to see in a while, then grab it and press it straight in between two hard white buns, then hand it to someone who allows them to smear the whole thing in all the tangy white sauce their little heart could hope for before sticking the whole thing in their gaping maw, allowing all the sauce to fall all around their face and abs...that company can't be THAT anti-GLBT.
identity_directed_animosity	I'm not defending people that harass women or saying it's okay. I'm just trying to show that being a man isn't all what these ladies think it's cracked up to be; a lot of women are pretty blind to the double standards which i'm sure you're aware of.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Do you think you'd have needed to be depressed and alone if you were not male? No.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You're putting words in my mouth, I've never said half the things you're accusing me of.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]
identity_directed_animosity	On the last one I think they're talking about transmen. This person is kinda right, but for fucks sake I don't think we need to constantly make sure everything related to gender and/or sex needs to be completely inclusive to the tiny percentage of people who are trans or whatever. Only affects a small number of people, as long as it's not actively trying to push them out I don't think they really care, and including them in every single thing would just make it more complicated.
identity_directed_animosity	The only "gay" art genres are: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anatomically inaccurate political comics by the sjws  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Ocs that look like they were made by a three year old who has no understanding of color theory [linebreak]  [linebreak] Furry porn [linebreak]  [linebreak] The "Tumblr" tm artstyle. (Colored nose, skin darker than portrayed by the original character, colored hair for no reason, stretch marks) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Blurry pictures of whatever abomination you drew on your sketch pad with a number 2 pencil. [linebreak]  [linebreak] According to Tumblr, anyway.
identity_directed_animosity	Transtrenders remind me of that episode of The Office where the jackass boss guy burns his foot and then acts like he knows everything there is to know about being disabled and refuses to listen to those who have actually lived with a disability.  Burning your foot and being on crutches for a week sucks, but it's not nearly at the level of being bedridden for a year or having a chronic condition.  Being gender-nonconforming can suck, but it's not nearly at the level of being trans.

identity_directed_animosity	I.. I don't get what they are spun about? Is it because they didn't specifically mention the eleven gender combinations who aren't biologically women but might menstruate? But the more important question is: If you have the time to call out Teen vogue for fucks sake, over something as completely inconsequential as this, you really are living a life of privilege and luxury unheard of by most of humanity for most of human history.. and should really shut the fuck up while you are ahead.

identity_directed_animosity	I mean, the whole thing is obviously bullshit, but if you play along... On what grounds do they consider men biologically inferior? I'm pretty sure if you go with pure biology and look at us like you would any animal, men are bigger, faster, stronger, and testosterone naturally makes them more likely to fight and gives them more drive... In any sort of environment not governed by man-made laws, the average man would just do what he wants with the average woman...
identity_directed_animosity	I feel like bros before hoes is legit when you're talking about making a really impactful decision, like where to vacation or who to emotionally support at a given moment or something along those lines. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If it's something like 'picking friends up but you got a last minute opportunity to get laid' I think that's something that a 'bro' should forgive as long as it wasn't something drastically important, like being a ride to a doctors appointment or job interview.
identity_directed_animosity	>and you're duty-bound to pay 50 bucks a plate for her anyways? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Inviting someone to literally anything than backing out of it for anything is a asshole move. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You've never had a girl pull the move this one did? Depending on how goddamn crazy she is it was just a test to see if he was interested in her or just sex since lol hotel, no flings, "not interested in a relationship right now"  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Women lol
identity_directed_animosity	Lol at cancel scolds saying others would sell out people for crumbs. That's their entire premise [linebreak]  [linebreak] "sorry girl, you said 'real women' once on twitter 5 years ago, gotta throw you under the bus and tattle you to the Party so I can keep a internship with that rich dude's son in a wig" [linebreak]  [linebreak] I think the commie girl's comment about wanting traditional relationships and talking about 'soy' nerds being gross is what secretly REALLY made them angry
identity_directed_animosity	We sure had a good laugh about it during lunch. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Jokes and funny chinglish aside, she probably didn't send it for no reason, notice how it came just 2 days after a certain anniversary. Coincidence? I think not. Probably came from up high. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Is the CCP now going to try and actively censor foreigners? LMAO good luck with that, I know my fair share of laowai who would rather get deported than self-censor to preserve the harmony.
identity_directed_animosity	> not a single conservative-leaning group has managed to make even one popular mainstream website [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not fair! You can't get a great website cause your uncle is the Sherrif, or the manager at the hardware store, or because every other website is black! You can't just get born onto land that has great websites in the ground for you to pay others to dig up! It's impossible for a conservative to succeed in these unfair oppressive conditions!
identity_directed_animosity	I'm sick and tired of baby names that people come up with nowadays. Some of them are downright ugly and trashy. Some totally made up.

identity_directed_derogation	That's exactly what a manlet would say [linebreak]  [linebreak] what I would give to kidnap a midget like you and make his life a living hell. I would force him to dress up in elf and leprechaun outfits and subject him to pure awfulness and humiliation. just terrible degradation and shameful acts. it would be so easy to break his spirit and drive him to suicide, but I wouldn't let him do it. if I could train a dog to rape on command then I would totally do that as well. a really big dog like a mastiff. he would be so completely and utterly powerless to stop it, not to mention terrified. a big ass dog is even scary and life-threatening to a normal human but to a midget? might as well be a dragon. I'd keep him in a cell and what's more is that I would actually place to key inside with him but put it in a high place. not extremely high but just ever so slightly out of reach. it would drive him mad. I would dress him like a baby and force feed him 99 cent store baby food. I'd also pick him up like a child and toss him from one corner to the next. I'd grab him by one leg and swing him as hard and as fast as I could then hurl him to see how far he goes. I'd rent one of those giant inflatable bounce houses and body slam him all day until my arms got tired. I'd hold him down with 1 hand and slowly stick things up his butt just to see him squirm. I would stick him in dryers and turn them on and leave him in there for long periods of time. I'd force him to fight other midgets to the death. just so many things I would do.

identity_directed_derogation	No, it is factually true. If you don't have dysphoria, that means you're comfortable with your genitals, meaning you aren't trans. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > In reference to Genders? Unknown. As Gender is a psychological way of thinking there is theoretically countless Genders. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Gender is "how comfortable you are with your genitals". If you have a penis and are ok with it, you're a man, if not, you're a transwoman, and the same for vaginas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't confuse "gender roles" with "gender". Being a man doesn't preclude you from wearing dresses and being a woman doesn't preclude you from working as a trucker. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > In reference to Biological Sex? a confirmed minimum of 4. As Sex is a Physical characteristic, at the moment we can confirm 4 different Sex characteristics (Penis, Vagina, Both P & V or Neither) but this could change in the future. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's no biological basis for this. Anomalies are exactly that, anomalies, they do not form part of the characteristics of the species, and humans are a sexual species, meaning two sexes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > With all of this Gender/Sex/Sexuality discussions we need to remember that it's a change field of research and if my years of Sexology education and research has told me anything, it's that everything we know is changing and we're finding out more and more about Human sexuality every single day. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Humans aren't special, we're exactly like almost every other mammal as far as sex comes.
identity_directed_derogation	Most guys are shameless lust-animals who want nothing other than to infect as many women as possible with their seed, and who can't help but gawk and chase after any girl they see who is even slightly physically attractive, no matter how many lives they ruin or whom they make feel uncomfortable and disrespected. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I do not want to participate in that. It is undignified for the men, and it is certainly harmful to the women, but worst of all, it destroys trust. It makes men and women assume things about each other, just from the fact that they are a man or a woman, even if they didn't choose to be, and even if they haven't done anything yet. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have identified the stereotypically male part of my sexuality, and I have killed it and buried it deep underground. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I want the men and women of the world to know that I am without lust, and the only way to prove that is to commit myself to never have sexual pleasure again. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But I'm not a sociopath. I still want to connect with another human being. I want to respect her and show her that she is a fellow human, not a sexual object; and I want to earn her respect so she can see that I am also a fellow human, and not a pig. I want to be the example for a more harmonious future.
identity_directed_derogation	A few years ago, I went to a fighting game tournament. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I was there to see some SF4, and some big names were there (Jwong, Fchamp, Snake Eyes).  [linebreak] Of course, being a large tournament, there were other games. Guilty Gear, Skullgirls (a tranny got 2nd place on this one), Mortal kombat, all the usual games. Of course, this includes Smash. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Smash was kept in a separate room, attached to the large conference hall. It was an individual conference room, about the size of a tennis court. I walked in to check it out. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This room was filled with males, ranged 13 to 30. All of their combined body odor, smelly feet, and sweat patches assaulted my nose immediately. Most were wearing graphic tee shirts and athletic mesh shorts. This allows the smell to escape much more easily than jeans. White Nike New Balances or sandals. Most were wearing backpacks. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've mostly forgotten about it, because it was years ago, but I will never forget that smell.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I read this post, I could smell it again. I can't think of a logical, scientific reason for this response.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't understand why a long post from r/ImJustaBagofHammers would trigger this memory in me.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't know why, but I do know this: I never want to remember that smell again.
identity_directed_derogation	Everyone's so worried about *school shooters that they caused**to care that more people die from suicide by gun than anything else in America. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Real mental health awareness could save a lot of lives in this country. Imagine if everyone got the help they needed?  People could have meaningful relationships. People could enjoy things again. People would stop killing themselves and each other in droves. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: * *There's a difference between psycho spree shooters and a shooters who wants revenge for being tormented. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's a touchy subject but if you don't make the distinction you can't put the blame where it really belongs.  Psychos are psycho. They're going to kill someone or something.* It's all a matter of when.* and it's rare when they're caught before they do something because they come off as normal teenage outcasts. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As for the bullied shooters. [linebreak] *Did anyone ever think they went too far with their bullying before their classmate pulled a gun?* [linebreak] Did the school staff notice ? Or did they let him / her fall through the cracks into a void of misery and depression? Did anyone even bother to make the effort to reach out to them ? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm just tired of this hindsight is 20/20 bullshit. Bullied shooters can be prevented if we all stopped being assholes to each other.
identity_directed_derogation	Guns are not the problem just like video games weren't the problem. Why do countries enlist or conscript young men? What happens when you remove all hope from a young man? What happens when you tell a young man from the time that he is old enough to learn that he is what is wrong with the world? What happens when you pump a young, hormonal, easily malleable full of wall to wall gore and death? What happens when you remove all male influences from that young man's life? His father is out of the picture, his teachers are all female, the advertisements and films he watches portray men as bumbling or stupid. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I welcome the downvotes, because every single one reinforces how right I am: women should have never be given the right to vote. America has been in absolute decline since women were included in politics. The feminization of everything has left young males with no outlet for their undeveloped minds and bodies to release anger. Eventually video games about shooting up airports and films about shooting up <insert America's enemy of the week> is not enough and that rage presents itself with massacres at elementary schools.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or the government is training autistic people with radio waves into hardened MKULTRA killers. Whatever helps you avoid an uncomfortable truth.
identity_directed_derogation	Yeah, guess Robert Paxton and other academics that specialize in fascism are just retarded. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is my biggest issue on this sub, people with no formal education on a subject mistaking actual facts for ignorance because again, they have no formal education on the subject. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Fascism is completely fluid, that's why you identify fascism using a set of emotional traits and national mood. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >  Even scholars who specialize in the quest for fascism's intellectual and cultural origins, such as George Mosse, declare that the establishment of a "mood" is more important than "the search for some individual precursors." In that sense too, fascism is more plausibly linked to a set of "mobilizing passions" that shape fascist action than to a consistent and fully articulated philosophy. At bottom is a passionate nationalism. Allied to it is a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history as a battle between the good and evil camps, between the pure and the corrupt, in which one's own community or nation has been the victim. In this Darwinian narrative, the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers who lack the necessary sense of community. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The anatomy of fascism.
identity_directed_derogation	So the other day I was taking out the trash, and I dropped the bag just outside of the parking garage. It was a shitty cigarette-paper-thin plastic bag, so it ruptured and plenty of garbage leaked out. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I was pissed, and considered for a second to go back upstairs and get a broom. But then a panorama rolled in front of my eyes: [linebreak]  [linebreak] - 8 AM drilling [linebreak]  [linebreak] - 6 AM fireworks [linebreak]  [linebreak] - nongs blocking the staircase with old rusty bicycles [linebreak]  [linebreak] - cars going 60 km/h in the xiao qu [linebreak]  [linebreak] - dog shit [linebreak]  [linebreak] - the bunch of yappy little dogs imprisoned in one of the garages, constantly barking [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I left the bag exactly where it laid, I only pulled out a paper towel and took the empty package of food flavoring Rainy used the night before that was very visible and would incriminate me if she saw it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A few hours later she bitched about the low-life who dropped his garbage outside the parking garage and I whistled innocently. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Chinar truly is turning me into a psychopath.
identity_directed_derogation	This sounds elitist as hell, but while there are certainly many good things about how social media has somewhat democratized the dissemination of thought, I find it depressing that so much credence now seems to be put into the hot takes and half-baked opinions of yokels, naive people, the overly-sensitive, bigots, etc.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The worst part is how viral it can be when that portion of the population with poor critical thinking skills/no considered opinion of their own that seemingly needs to be told what to think, or those with a pre-existing agenda, get ahold of it and make it relevant by sharing/repeating it and giving it momentum, and now suddenly it's influencing society to some degree. It happens all over the political spectrum, be it hateful agitation that creates fears or negative sentiments, or someone who decides that something innocuous is offensive if you look at it a certain way and creates outrage where there wasn't any. (Of course, meaningful societal changes sometimes come about in the same way - I refer more to Tumblrific absurdities like saying it's a sign of patriarchal privilege that condoms are often given away for free but not tampons.)
identity_directed_derogation	I was thinking about the Antarctic Treaty and it specifically lays out things we consider progressive or Green.  The treaty lays out the following (from the Antarctica wikipedia page):  [linebreak]    [linebreak] "The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's ecozone."    [linebreak]    [linebreak] Couple this with Antarctica's often forgotten *16,000 ft elevation*, making it the highest continent on Earth, and you've got to ask yourself -- are the 'elite' building under the ice and preparing to sequester themselves away while the ice caps melt? They'd have an undisturbed, elevated (above the rising sea levels) landmass to survive on while the rest of us starve or bomb ourselves out of existence.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] Its extremely curious to me that Antarctica is one of the few things that a consensus can be reached on by almost every nation on the planet. Additionally, resource mining is prohibited on the continent until 2048.  Is that our real end date?   [linebreak]    [linebreak]    [linebreak] Just something that had crossed my mind and wanted to share with my fellow free thinkers.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] Peace and love to all of you
identity_directed_derogation	Slippery slope fallacy isn't actually a fallacy it turns out. [linebreak]  [linebreak] "We just want to be openly gay" [linebreak]  [linebreak] "We just want to get married" [linebreak]  [linebreak] "We just want to parade our degeneracy in public and have an entire month dedicated to us" [linebreak]  [linebreak] "We just want to force you to provide services to us" [linebreak]  [linebreak] "We just want to have the state teach the homosexual way to your kids" [linebreak]  [linebreak] "We just want you to give your kids the hormones of the opposite sex which sterilizes them and causes all sorts of other mental and physical problems but we'll have the state take them away if you don't" [linebreak]  [linebreak] "We just need to understand pedophiles, no one is condoning pedophilia" [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Pedophilia is just a sexual preference like being gay or lesbian" [linebreak]  [linebreak] "There are now over 9000 genders - learn them and use them properly or go to jail (*in Canada)" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yea for me lesson learned.

identity_directed_derogation	So? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Jews are by far the wealthiest and most influential group on earth. Whenever criticised, we always hear "oy vey muh rising Ann Tie Summer Tism", even though criticising whites is the dominant unifying factor of Jewish culture. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The cat is out of the bag now. We're aware of the scam being run, and along with other disgraceful behaviours like the treatment of Palestinians, the fueling of the American Military Industrial Complex, and the Jewish control of the Immigrant Industrial Complex and the media... Jews as a people are going to get a LOT of flack in the coming years.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] But hey! Jews keep telling us about the importance of egalitarianism... so I suppose they'll have no problem accepting some of the hatred they have been inciting against white people for a few hundred years.

identity_directed_derogation	According to the DNA test they did she's mostly Hakka or some other Guangdong minority. But as a matter of fact, Cantofags are genetically closer to the Vietnamese than they are to the Han. There is a reason Vietnam literally means Southern Viet Kingdom, there was once a Northern Viet Kingdom and it was Guangxi + Guangdong before China incorporated it. But don't tell them all that, most these days have been brainwashed to believe that they are Han, once a real ethnicity for people from Hebei, Henan, Shandong, etc... aka The Original Chinese™, now nothing more than a political motto to maintain social cohesion and prevent the Guo from disintegrating if people realize that anyone who isn't from Henan and surrounding provinces isn't actually Han. And I mean just look at Guangdong, the old architecture, the customs, the traditions, the food, it screams Vietnam a lot more than it says China. Cantonese sounds a lot more like Vietnamese to the uninitiated ear than it sounds like Mandarin.
identity_directed_derogation	>the language needs to evolve because as we learn more about what it means to be human and all the various nuances of identity and expression, we need to accept that the world isn't as black and white as we might think. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The language is fine the way it is - it makes sense that women are exclusively female, and men are exclusively male, because that's *simply what those words were created to mean*.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The concepts of 'man' and 'woman' don't exist without the biology they refer to; what's the point in confusing everything, muddying the waters of basic, sensible, standard terminology just to pander to the delusions of a small percentage of mentally unstable people, when it ultimately changes nothing about their physical reality? [linebreak]  [linebreak] People need to learn that they're capable of existing outside of basic biological and even social labels. Your entire identity as a human doesn't need to revolve around being a male/man or female/woman.
identity_directed_derogation	Macau used to be a cool sleepy colonial backwater until ostensibly around 2002 when the gambling market opened up and then around 2008 when China started to allow individual visas. Since then it's been packed with nongs year round and lost a lot of that old world charm. It's good for actual card bearing residents and non-dancing monkey expats because salaries are high and taxes are ridiculously low. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Still, if you're not a complete rube like op, there's a lot of things that even Hong Kong doesn't have because it's older and there wasn't the mad rush to bulldoze everything with even the least amount of historical value in the name of money. Chinese food is also better than HK and much cheaper. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Most locals still speak Canto and it's still the main teaching language in most public schools. They do learn Mandarin so if you want to be treated like the renminbi pinhata that you are, go right ahead.
identity_directed_derogation	Fuck you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Aboriginal people suffered, yes, because they were poor. Same as the convicts. This is NOT about race, this is about economic exploitation and class dynamics. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Convicts are hardly victims of racial oppression though, because they were sent here by other white people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] No fucking shit, Sherlock. Maybe that's why I didn't say they were oppressed because of race. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But there you go, just like an SJW, "look at how your white neighbour has a little more than you, how your black neighbour is on the dole, look at differential crime rates, look at the drunken abos, look at the dole bludgers... Just don't, for the love of god, look at the guys who own the TV companies and the newspapers. Don't look at the well-fed and well-paid academics spouting this bullshit. Don't question why your job was sent abroad for tax reasons. Don't ask why your pay rises haven't kept up with inflation."
identity_directed_derogation	Israel has an impressive nuclear arsenal, and submarines to deliver it. Of course, they built none of it themselves. Also keep in mind they are an extremely vengeful bunch, and many still believe Europeans/Christians tried to "exterminate" them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] About the Samson option: [linebreak]  [linebreak] > We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force. Let me quote General Moshe Dayan: 'Israel must be like a mad dog, too dangerous to bother.' I consider it all hopeless at this point. We shall have to try to prevent things from coming to that, if at all possible. Our armed forces, however, are not the thirtieth strongest in the world, but rather the second or third. We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under. [linebreak]  [linebreak] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option
identity_directed_derogation	Well for one, there is a good chance there is something wrong with you if you have no sexual attraction to anyone. You may be asexual, but you may also have a hormonal imbalance or other underlying medical condition you should have investigated. Also, what you're describing is the human condition. There isn't a person alive that hasn't thought there was something wrong with them. I don't think thats a unique experience in the slightest. We may as well include people with IBS or underactive thyroids in the LGBT umbrella if this is the bar being set.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Secondly, there is no such thing as aromantic. That is not an orientation. Romantic partnering is a cultural creation, not a biological reality. This has been studied. There is a great deal of variability from culture to culture. Some cultures have primarily homosocial intimate pairings and sexual relationships are separate and primarily for procreation and recreation. So aromantic is not an orientation at all.
identity_directed_derogation	In other TiA posts I noted that gender identity activists don't merely want the right to be who they are or to be treated as just another human being, they want *preferential* treatment. Which is how they can accuse statements rooted in biology to be "transphobic," because it gets in the way of being treated preferentially to the rest of the population.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] That's also how you can still be considered a hateful, harmful, *dangerous* person even if you treat transgendered people the same way you'd respectfully treat anyone else. I have a strong suspicion the fellow claiming TiA is a hate sub considers anyone who *doesn't* provide enthusiastic praise for being trans as "hateful," hence why I mentioned the Anakin Skywalker mentality. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which would necessarily include a lot of the transgendered/nonbinary TiA regulars who aren't fond of this shit either. Then again, activists like these are quite notorious for treating dissent among their own favored demographics as treason.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Any day now. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > [linebreak] Nothing that happens to Trump, at this point, is going to dissuade them. These people have finally had a taste of a President who was openly, nakedly racist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If he's so openly racist, why do you people keep talking about "dog whistles"? [linebreak]  [linebreak] > [linebreak] Just think what he's truly given them. They've watched their entire lives as social pressure has eroded and driven their naked racism into the shadows. These are people who lived through segregation and liked it, and their children, who grew up in that toxic environment and internalized those twisted values. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Irony: someone denigrating the right for being prejudiced...based entirely on their prejudiced views of the right.
identity_directed_derogation	I'm still shocked nobody has taken the law into their own hands when that kind of shit happens. Like, imagine your in a hurry somewhere. Maybe your wife just went into labor and you are trying to get to the hospital, or you just have to take a massive shit and you are trying to get home. You need to make a left at the light and a bunch of ANTIFA retards are blocking the street and not letting anyone go.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] They have no permit, no authority, and no clearance to do this. Calling the cops gets you nowhere and the police do nothing. Honestly, I'd tell the cops that if they won't do anything to clear up the obstruction, I would. And they would not like my methods. I would make Dylan Roof's massacre look like childs play. And it all could have been avoided if the rule of law was just enforced on these tyrants.
identity_directed_derogation	So someone was discussing the idea of a gay/lesbian person being attracted to one person of the opposite sex, and if that would make them automatically bisexual. I innocently commented that there have been stories I've read online of homosexual people talking about that exception, and that they still overall consider themselves homosexual. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Cue the double digit downvotes and snark from Redditors who claim that's bullshit and it "never happens". It's funny (and hypocritical) how the LGBT+ community harps about fluidity in sexuality yet they themselves are super fucking rigid about labels. Because gays can never, ever, EVER find someone else of the opposite sex attractive or fall for them otherwise. Nope. Never happens. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just fuck this website, fuck the LGBT+ community. I know, I know. "Why are you still on here?" Well, I've barely been posting lately so I am weaning myself off this place little by little...

identity_directed_derogation	I said this before ill say it again ..You fuckers with your conservative views and unwillingness to changed have fucked up so much. The mess you've left the world in will take decades to fix. Fuck you all. Fuck your racism. Fuck your inability to flex on fucking anything. I hate you. Your fuckers are the goddamn fucking worst. Thanks for trump. and brexit. and la pen. Fuck you. Fuck your lazy fucking oldness and your "Oh I'm an old dog and can't do new tricks" bullshit. Fuck right off . I've had this sitting on my chest for months. Jesus fucking christ I hate you. thanks so much for a world where your children will clean up your messes. Remember how you would always scold us when we didn't clean the table? Thanks for fucking up the planet and society. Suck a monstrous cock, Fuck you.
identity_directed_derogation	All that you just mentioned birthed the alt Reich movement. What the fuck is a Breitbart anyways? I'd never heard of it before the alt Reich, maybe it was around, but certainly not in the same way. Sufficient that most people hadn't heard of it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The cause and effect between the Russians and the alt Reich is really well documented, is that what you want help on? [linebreak]  [linebreak] These lonely white nerd dudes were always sexist, but it took a subversive directed force to motivate organise and radicalise them into the anti-woman activism we saw in gamer hate. Those groups went on to form the basis of the alt Reich, nay the very definitive core of it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] None of this has any leaps or unusual or out there ideas. These are all mainstays of the current and recent years media cycle.
identity_directed_derogation	I thought state-issued sex slaves was part of the western incel platform too. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: I've never really thought about it much and unfortunately I'm banned at most every lefty sub but the incel-marxist argument would be fun to troll communists with just to see where they would draw the line on body-autonomy since I never see it brought up by them. Why should your body be the one thing you are allowed to own? It's a resource that should be owned by the state and distributed in whichever way is going to benefit society the most. Being pro-choice shouldn't be a thing in a communist society. Chad hitting the genetic lottery is no different than being born a billionaire's son. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Incels rise up! Overthrow the genetic bourgeoisie! A tendie in every pot and a virginal, pubescent Stacy in every rape dungeon!
identity_directed_derogation	Also, I have never said I hate white men, quite contrary, I like them as long asthey recognize and acknowledge their place in the world: that is, under the foot of a black man, same goes for all you cucks. The true evil in this world is /r/SubredditDrama, which is my only enemy. Hitler was an animal rights advocate, and I quite like animals too, so I have nothing against white people per ce, just don't think rapid babboons should be running on the streets among people, smh. Once the /r/SubredditDrama cancer is gone and social order is restored, we can live in harmony with the subhumans, they in their lard, and we in our cities.

identity_directed_derogation	Why people can't see the writing on the wall is beyond me. Incentives for foreigners to come to western nations to over throw them? Obviously the elites want elimination of western culture and values (Christianity). This is the locust army of the Revelation 13, the muslims in Europe, and the Latinos and other ethnic non natives in the USA IMO. The mark of the beast comes when we can no longer buy or sale at Amazon because we made a bad post about pedophiles on our social media. If you say something derogatory about transgenders, your company will fire you and you will be put on billboards for having a poor social credit score. The image of the beast is the tv / smart phone screens. The super natural messiah of the beast system will return within 15 years IMO.
identity_directed_derogation	This might come as a shock to you, but I do not care about your opinions, your ignorance or failure to comprehend the research, or what you believe. The only thing I care about, and I can not stress this enough, is what the empirical research says. And it says you are wrong. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Your personal opinion? worth as much as a pile of dog shit on the sidewalk to me. That is the absolute extent to which I care about what you think. This is where I stopped reading. I do not entertain the economic illiteracy of far leftists or far right-wing tards.

identity_directed_derogation	You seem fun and totally well-adjusted! [linebreak]  [linebreak] But seriously, I know that you're still mad at your parents for making you do the dishes after dinner, but that's no reason to waste your energy spreading hysterical hatred on the internet. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Your real problem is the same as everyone else in your age group - you have no real problems or perspective on life.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] From the climate change hysteria they have spoon-fed you since birth to the fashionable anti-Trump fever, you have been conditioned to become a miserable basket case for the social and political benefit of others.  You are being manipulated into a simplistic and foolish view of the world where you are good and *they* are evil.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] This isn't one of your comic book fantasies, it is real life.
identity_directed_derogation	That same mod unironically calls piewdiepie a Nazi in the linked post lmao [linebreak]  [linebreak] I gotta say, the NZ shooter was a moronic piece of shit (in my experience only complete retards believe in "the great replacement"), but in a way he had to be somewhat intelligent. I'm sure he knew people would jump to attack *and* defend piewdiepie, which goes along with his whole crazy helter skelter "sow division" scheme. Kind of off-topic I guess, but it's interesting how people have gone right along with his plan in some regards (another example being reactionary NZ gun legislation, which was his claimed reason for choosing firearms as his weapon). I hope he rots miserably in prison, but holy shit was he spot on in a lot of ways.
identity_directed_derogation	Imagine being filled with so much hate towards your creator, you bash the people who pray you find the good and truth.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Believe what you want, atheists sure like pointing fingered towards a problem they aren't involved in then criticize from the outside looking in. They don't go to mass, most of them don't even have a clue how a mass works let alone what a sacrament is. The media blows up a problem that really doesn't happen, and is just as dangerous as sending your child to swim lessons at the ymca.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I bet these ignoramus think a priests' homily is what happened to them by their uncle causing them to hate god and themselves.
identity_directed_derogation	People with PCOS who are too fat to defend themselves or run away are fun to abuse. I like to take a spoon, heat it up until it's glowing hot, then place it on the skin while they're asleep. The reaction when they wake up after the 25th time of being burned by a redhot piece of metal is amazing. You can literally piecemeal their mental stability down to complete insanity, then leave them in their own homes helpless and alone. :DDDDDDDDDD [linebreak]  [linebreak] Snapshots: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1.

identity_directed_derogation	Why do you people do this? It's so fucking cringey. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You just jump into random conversations and try to shoe in irrelevant "gotcha!s" that have nothing to do with what anyone's talking about.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It just comes off as desperate and childish. You can't even wait for a relevant thread, you straight up lack the patience for that like a kid who can't wait until after dinner to eat dessert. You're just itching to jump in and own the redrumpflikkans! But in doing so you just come off as a sperg or a schizoid. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, how about that whole Obama murdering migrant toddlers in Brown Baby Death Camps thing?
identity_directed_derogation	Look you retards, when the posts here are basically the same thing every single day and the bot has like 3 different phrases, of course they are going to match up a lot. You idiots post links to anything that matches up with your gay ass drama buzzwords.

identity_directed_derogation	I suppose it's just a visceral reaction. Like my aversion to coprophilia or bestiality. I find the concept of two men sodomising each other to be sickening. Honestly, I don't care what people do in the privacy of their own homes, within reason. If two men want to practice homosexuality in private, then that's their concern. But I object to the normalisation of homosexuality because I think that it's a revolting tendency which should not be considered normal or healthy, nor should it form a part of accepted society. I despise transsexualism because it is clearly a form of mental illness, and accepting it enables it.
identity_directed_derogation	When you purchase a company, you also purchase all of its contracts. Those would be sales contracts and contracts to employees and debtors. So yes, sears douche has a legal obligation to pay the severances since that's something he purchased as a responsibility. If he had no intention of pay the severances then they needed to be paid by the seller prior to sale or escrow the funds from sale to have paid at the proper time. If the bankruptcy court rules him not liable to pay on these contracts, all it proves is the country is morally bankrupt and shitbag rich people don't have rules
identity_directed_derogation	The "working class" are the workers who have some tiny amount of capital, like they own land and a house [linebreak]  [linebreak] People who are just workers, rent and can't spare enough to actually buy a house, and didn't inherit sweet homestead act grants from stolen Indian lands, are literally just welfare tho [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you're not a white man in a hard hat, you are not working class. Working class has nothing to do with working, what idiot thinks you're in the working class just because you work, instead of being a very specific representation of a myth in the mind of a  rightoid
identity_directed_derogation	This is how cultural marxism works. You put every single minority first at all times no matter what. (((They))) used it to destroy Occupy Wall Street. This is why (((they))) push multikulti. (((They))) admit that (((they))) have a much easier time taking advantage of divided, heterogeneous societies rather than homogeneous societies. It is why (((they))) pushed feminism, civil rights, the homosexual agenda, etc. (((Their))) entire playbook is divide and conquer. Divide male and female, divide black and white, divide normal and abnormal. And always, always, always demand that the minority gets preferential treatment. After all, (((they))) are the permanent parasitic minority.
identity_directed_derogation	I'm not sure they even identify as this.. although I know Keanu had a troubled childhood he got lots of chicks and concentrated on acting and doing cool shït.. sometimes you have to work out if you have a fate to suffer or a destiny to fulfil. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That said I've seen a few expats who make horrible husbands and fathers, worse yet, they do choose fucked up asian women to spawn with... do the world a favour,if you aren't going to stick around and be the kind of father your kids deserve.. don't fucking breed.
identity_directed_derogation	>This is on a spectrum with Asian-Americans being termed the "model minority," a toxic label intended to separate us from other people of color, meant to press us into the service of white supremacy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Of course, it was all a conspiracy by those dastardly white people to ensure Asians would never be able to make common cause with "other people of colour"... I mean, it's not like there's any racism or animosity between non-white groups or, gasp, even different Asian peoples? [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And, of course, only "people of colour" can be "minorities."
identity_directed_derogation	Same. I've literally had to ask a woman's husband to come put a muzzle on his bitch, because no matter how many times I said no, she still kept grabbing, touching, and trying to fuck me. At one point she was literally on the ground in front of my seat trying to pull my thighs apart. I've had times where guys would pull shit like that, but never for so long and never so brazenly after I'd said a firm no (she basically pulled this shit multiple times over the span of an entire night).
identity_directed_derogation	I use the slur because it goes ahead a singles out the people who aren't going to listen to me anyways. If we can have a valid discussion even after my use of slurs then that means your at least open to my opinion, which saves me time and energy. That's not to say I don't think certain black people are niggers, I do. But I think there is also a not so insignificant amount of black people who want peace and happiness for all. I'd consider them brothers. Same applies for all other races.
identity_directed_derogation	Whenever I go out to an Indian Restaurant with my family, I have noticed that the restaurants are often named as Indian and Pakistani Cuisine. In most cases, the owner is Paki. I have had a very difficult itme finding a restaurant owned by a true Viraat a true Bakht and not one owned by Mullahs. If they serve Beef, it is easy to tell if it is a Mullah restaurant or not. What are other ways I can find out if a restaurant is owned by a true Hindustani or not?
identity_directed_derogation	I'm working on a new theory: [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you can't make it using bolts, screws, nuts or nails ... it ain't a construct.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] This leads us to the inevitable (and I must say elegant) conclusion that what these dipshits are talking about are figments of their imagination. Delusions, if you will.

Its the shame that the greatest religion in the world is loosing its last bastion.

identity_directed_derogation	> "...most of these undocumented immigrants are probably more educated than most assholes complaining about them and contributing more to society than they ever have."  [linebreak]  [linebreak] LOL, yeah they are not contributing to society, they are literally running away from a problematic one, and if they were "more educated" then "us assholes" then why couldn't they figure out how to *help* their countrymen instead of abandoning them and why did they assume that America would welcome them with open arms and wallets?  Not smart *and* not wise.

identity_directed_derogation	>Mr. Immergluck favors an idea that would grant down-payment assistance, as Ms. Warren proposes, but that would target households with low family wealth. Ideally, he said, such a program would count parental wealth, too, given that whites [are far more likely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/04/how-your-parents-affect-your-chances-of-buying-a-home/) than African-Americans to receive down payment assistance (or any kind of financial help) from their parents. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In other words, Warren's proposal is a decent idea, but the only problem is that those filthy crackers would benefit too. Can't have that.

identity_directed_derogation	No, there are plenty of lazy and dumb women.  When you get far away from the mean, you find more men.  This is because men have a larger standard deviation in the intelligence distribution.  Further, men are more competitive than women.  Among other things, this drives them to seek out the best positions, work more overtime, and delay having a family.  Sure, a few women will have the intelligence and drive to be a doctor, but at a lower rate than men.
identity_directed_derogation	This is going for long time. [linebreak] Here we have a chutiya mughli supporter by the name of u/Sikander-i-Sani.

identity_directed_derogation	Congratulations, "Gamergate was a Russian psyop" is the stupidest thing I've read in weeks. Angry, alienated young white men looked for (and invented) a source for their problems, and extant hate groups like Breitbart were quick to capitalize on that - that was when Milo started becoming a prominent figure. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Honestly, this take is so brain-meltingly dumb that I'm hesitant to ask, but what on earth could possibly lead you to think that *Russia* was in any way involved?
identity_directed_derogation	These companies just don't get it. They get screamed at for not representing the mentally ill. Then when they do, they get screamed at for representing the mentally ill. Then they fucking apologize. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like, why did you put yourself in the situation that you're going to have to apologize to the sharks for bleeding in their waters. Stop catering to the insane, and stop apologizing when you do and it still pisses off the people you are pandering to.
identity_directed_derogation	As the population plays more and more fornight the focus is on kill death ratio. While the majority of shooters are black because of the pressures to single out white men as evil instead of focusing on the statistics of how many of the shooters are of a certain race they decided to go by the K/D or Kill death ratio. I guess what they are trying to say is that White people are better at shooting guns I dont know.

identity_directed_derogation	Imagine the Amish, but they didn't keep to themselves, wandered around the country from place to place without picking up after themselves, had no respect for private property, actually sent their kids to school but discouraged them from getting anything out of it because it would challenge their cultural hegemony, and didn't [keep their more fucked up behavior secret](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/us/03amish.html).

identity_directed_derogation	Vic2 > CK2 [linebreak]  [linebreak] Let's you violently repress political radicals and racial minorities while building the chaddest empire in the world, or alternatively build a centrist utopia in the Americas for all the people to stream to. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One interesting strategy, for example, is to direct immigration (should you be recieve enough) to areas with rebellious cultures. The immigrants will slowly outnumber the natives and then assimilate to your proper culture destroying the native homeland.
identity_directed_derogation	Well that's always the conundrum. I was reading "Poorly Made in China", the book about the manufacturing sector, and they were talking about Taiwanese companies sometimes getting a preferential local tariff OR getting the dumb foreigner price for raw goods, but then some Taiwanese buyers would troll the greedy nong factory owner by saying "Oh, we're foreign to you? I thought Taiwan was in China?" and eventually they'd get their Mutumbo XXXXLs at a lower price.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not American, so I don't care what they do or don't on your soil. my issue is that Israel is the only NON SHITHOLE country in the region. that affords its terrorist inhabitants more rights than their native countries.

identity_directed_derogation	4chan really needs to make a list of all the authors who did the pile ons of those two books and make sure they point out all the problematic stuff in their new novels.

They can't actually create any happiness for themselves so they only live to spite others.
identity_directed_derogation	Do you see me going on those subs and then bitching? No, because I have the basic brain function you and that other user seem to lack, dumbass.

identity_directed_derogation	Far less so by England though.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unlike the Americans, the British never wanted to drive the natives to extinction (or to the edge of it) they never wanted to drive them out of huge swathes of the country, they wanted to rule over the natives, not exterminate them.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, if north America remained under the British, the natives would be in a far better spot today than in our timeline.
identity_directed_derogation	Methinks electr0smith is referring to PETA's notorious zeal in culling domesticated animals. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Killing off adoptable pets, even going as far as to *steal pets and kill them*, serves no practical purpose at all except in the deranged minds of these animal "rights" nutjobs. Their end goal is to keep people from having any sort of interaction with animals, at all. Not as farm animals, not as service animals, not as pets.
identity_directed_derogation	Well after reading those wonderful comments I have learned something important.

identity_directed_derogation	Biggest problem currently is that a huge fraction of the top social media sites are owned by forgieners who think that their money trumps our rights.

identity_directed_derogation	I mean let's be real though it's not like people aren't posting fights there because there white. They do post fights involving all white people.

Then they delete the comments drawing attention to the pattern and hope no one saw it.

identity_directed_derogation	This is what I'm confused about. I'm sure they intend the hijab as a sign of respect (as did Adern), but it's weird to see such a powerful symbol of female oppression being used that way.

identity_directed_derogation	I dont understand this, do we really need such a huge muslim population? If Pakistan is the part of India then we would be having Baloch separatists attacking Delhi or Mumbai. Not to mention the FATA, and millions of Rohingya's pouring into us.

identity_directed_counter_speech	I mean we are very often told we just don't exist. Faking it. Broken. Haven't met the right person. Freak because most people can't comprehend that there are people just don't have those feelings. It's not something we chose, asexuality is not celibacy. We absolutely haven't faced the same dangerous levels of discrimination as say gays or trans people but we still get shit on. Conversion rape is a thing ace people have been threatened with. I mean just look at a lot of this thread. Asexuality is such a far outlier of sexuality that it's hard for sexual people to understand.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Okay, I did, and your claim is misleading to put it mildly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] New York passed a law which EXPANDED access to state financial aid and scholarships to cover illegal immigrant children assuming that certain requirements are met.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] So basically they took what was already available to citizen students, and extended it to illegals.  Not free tuition, mind you, but financial aid. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Illegals aren't being given anything that isn't available already to citizens, right?  Including the "children of dead veterans" ???
identity_directed_counter_speech	which is unfortunately a bad message, because female to male transgender people still can experience period symptoms, because the vast majority of trans people don't actually get sex reassignment surgery. so there are indeed men who menstruate. the language needs to evolve because as we learn more about what it means to be human and all the various nuances of identity and expression, we need to accept that the world isn't as black and white as we might think.
identity_directed_counter_speech	> Your views on issues and status regarding money and how "far you are in life" are pretty fucking bigoted. Maybe you do need to give this girl a break from yourself, you sound hard to be around. "Transgender rights stuff" isn't something you can just ignore, it's fucking LIFE.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Being successful in life and letting others be is bigoted now. You just cant win with some people. [linebreak]
identity_directed_counter_speech	The race has nothing to do with it.  There are plenty of large democrat-controlled cities with white, Jewish, Latino, etc. politicians elected to office that are just as corrupt and badly managed.  I wouldn't be surprised to find some republican-run places with similar issues.  The problem isn't race.  The problem is letting one political party control literally everything in a given area.  It just opens the door to this kind of behavior.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Allow me to correct you... [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are two SEXES and how comfortable you are with yours [linebreak]  [linebreak] (And even this isn't 100% true because of XXY) [linebreak]  [linebreak] And the whole second part is only true for the special snowflakes, but I believe there are people that genuinely feel like they don't belong either as a "man" or a "woman", or even feel like they don't need any gender
identity_directed_counter_speech	Yes, It's those 5 or 6 countries, but Trump made sure to say ban Muslims from entering.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Are those white people coming from countries with no or poor document control, known for exporting terrorists under forged paperwork? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yea, even in Syria, there are white people. Neither of these statements make senses, that was the point of the first twitter post.
identity_directed_counter_speech	1. autism isn't a mental illness [linebreak] 2. it's not an excuse, it's an explanation as to *why* I do things most neurotypicals don't.

And usually I know to catch myself so that situation is super rare anyways.
identity_directed_counter_speech	...do you think gender-nonconforming people need special toilets or something? Toilets are segregated by the signs on their doors. Gender neutral signage is what makes a bathroom gender neutral, there's even specific prescriptions in building codes for what signage to use, so it's pretty reasonable someone might want such a part for a building they want to make in the game.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Forcing black mothers to keep unwanted children does more harm to that community. Whoever wrote this is either racist against black people, or some how entirely ignorant of the negative effects this would have on that group. Even aside from that, it removes any element of choice from one specific group and that's no different from being a pro-life cunt.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Nobody is pro-pedophilia other than like ancaps lmao. Nobody in the LGBT community defends this shit either (and no, 4/8chan meme operations don't count). Considering you complained about "muh slippery slope" simply starting with "gay people should exist" you obviously don't want gay people to just "be gay and leave me alone" dude, stop virtue signalling already.
identity_directed_counter_speech	So, if a black woman wants an abortion she should be unable to get one cause her baby is perfect? [linebreak]  [linebreak] What if her/her and the father can't support the child? Are you stating that she should just accept her fate and be forced to have children? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Wow, that sounds really regressive author!
identity_directed_counter_speech	I am the antithesis of the incel ideology, and a refutation to the entire concept of a "white knight" because I have proven that I am not a hypocrite. I do not have any hedonistic ulterior motives for trying to improve gender relations, so much so that I am willing to almost literally castrate myself.
identity_directed_counter_speech	This is a fucking reach. Its actually anti semitic too. Just because theyre jewish doesnt mean they have an innate hankering for subversion and destruction.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The real conspiracy: this is a mock post made to portray this sub as far right racists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That or youre really delusional.
identity_directed_counter_speech	No because the N-word is actually a derogatory term. [linebreak] Woman is literally defined as without man. This seems empowering because it implies that a woman doesn't need a man.  It was never used in the context of hate. [linebreak] Ok I will stop "mansplaining" now. [linebreak] Ugly term.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Alright. While I agree (if it's not a joke) that it's not cool to ban white people from the sub, comparing this situation to the civil rights movement is just stupid. One subreddit does not at all equate to the entire livelihood of the black American community.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Actually no, because it's not real. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It sounds like you support censoring peoples *thoughts* too, which is weird because usually the right wingers are all over being allowed to say whatever they want as long as no one is being harmed because free speech
identity_directed_counter_speech	incel stands for involuntary celibate. the term means people who are virgins but wish not to be. nowhere in that definition is there anything about gender, hate, or misogyny. the term gets thrown around so much today that people forget what it actually means.
identity_directed_counter_speech	I'm actually of the opinion that two adults can act however they want with consent. Maybe it's not normal but as long as they keep that shit private, I'm not too bothered. People don't come into r/drama and judge us for loving bussy.
identity_directed_counter_speech	> They take jobs and opportunities from natural citizens instead of staying in their own countries and making them better. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh yeah, because there's thousands of Americans fighting tooth and nail to get hard physical labor jobs in the fields.
identity_directed_counter_speech	I have been peeing in a gender-neutral bathroom at home my entire life but if I go to a public space with facilities that are safe for trans people to use it might literally kill me and society as a whole.
identity_directed_counter_speech	I'm not transphobic, I just think trans people are icky liars. What do you mean that's transphobic? I didn't say they should be executed just for being trans! Everyone knows that's the only way a person can be transphobic.
identity_directed_counter_speech	You can very much be trans without dysphoria. Some trans people aren't trans because it would be painful for them to live as their AGAB, but because they're happier as a different one. Gender euphoria as opposed to dysphoria.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Not to get pedantic, but genocide would actually cross into *forcing* abortions. It's also not actually eugenics, in that it doesn't forcefully sterilize undesirables and crossbreed those with desirable traits.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is, however, horrifying and short-sighted racism.
identity_directed_counter_speech	I mean sanity except for two points. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >You can't be trans without dysphoria [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sorry but that's just factually incorrect. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >There's only two genders [linebreak]  [linebreak] Again, just factually incorrect.
identity_directed_counter_speech	That's a slippery slope. What's next? Preventing Fundamentalists, Scientologists, Mohammedans, Communists, Socialists, etc., or those merely suspected of being something or other, from being allowed to work on other people's stuff?
identity_directed_counter_speech	I mean I guess. I don't really know, I can't speak for the asexual people cause I am not one, it's just my belief that they are apart of it.
identity_directed_counter_speech	No I got it. I hear the same thing from MGTOW. "Don't interact with women it's not worth the risk" it's disgusting whether it's directed toward women or other races.
identity_directed_counter_speech	\*checkes thread and OP\* [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Hmm nobody even seems to have insinuated this was posted by a black person, so your comment makes literally no sense.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Well sure, nobody except for other SJWs likes them. But to be frank, if you're referring to trans people as "trannys", you're not doing them any favors either.
identity_directed_counter_speech	I don't mind tbh. I really can't relate sorry. I judge people by their behaviour. I personally prefer a Pajama though, freedom of movement is great.
identity_directed_counter_speech	You are pretty unempathetic if you don't care about the civilians in Syria who have done nothing wrong but are in the middle of a war

identity_directed_counter_speech	that's not well said. it's just trying to justify that it's okay to attack people using sexuality as long as you have the right politics.
identity_directed_counter_speech	This just makes this subreddit look like any other racist dumpster fire. You want a coherent argument? Saying "black people+power= corruption" is racist.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Doesn't have anything to do with their race. People in power in general are corrupt, saying it's because they're black is just racist.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Are you implying you want a ethnostate but for men and women? Pretty weird comparisons for your social Darwinist views but sure
identity_directed_counter_speech	Erm, thanks. Just don't be racist, or you will give other subreddits ammunition. Besides, it's irrational, it's just a skin colour mate
