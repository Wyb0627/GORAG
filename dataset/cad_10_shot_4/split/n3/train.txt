identity_directed_animosity	In the recent past, I have lost friends, pets, and my father, the latter of which I watched decline very quickly after a cancer diagnosis. He had lung surgery and needed a device to drain fluid. It was broken. It was broken from the goddamn outset, but the hospital would not give him a new one because insurance said he was only allowed to have one, ever. IT WAS BROKEN. IT WAS FUCKING BROKEN. His doctor stole him a new one (A DOCTOR HAD TO STEAL A MEDICALLY NECESSARY DEVICE IN ORDER TO TEND TO HIS PATIENT. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT LONG AND HARD), but it didn't matter, because it was too late by then. And anyway, they wanted him out of the hospital when he went back in, because the money is made by cycling patients through, so they pushed him out as fast as they could, so fast that his own discharge came as a surprise to him, because no one had bothered to tell him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He worked his ass off his whole fucking life, and he was making six figures when he retired, so you fucking pricks don't sit there and tell me that only moochers complain about the state of our health care. Don't you sit there and fucking tell me that if you just *contribute* you won't have to worry. HE CONTRIBUTED. HE CONTRIBUTED YOU FUCKING FUCK. You're going to meet his fate, do you understand that? If you don't get on board with reforming things, then it doesn't fucking matter how powerful you think you are right now, you little shit. It doesn't matter how much fucking money you make. THE FUCKING DEATH PANELS ARE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, DO YOU HEAR ME? YOUR CADILLAC PLAN WILL DENY YOU SOMETHING YOU NEED SOME DAY FOR SOME BULLSHIT REASON AND YOU WILL FUCKING DIE YOU SELFISH SHORT-SIGHTED JACKASS, YOU WILL FUCKING DIE. I wish I could be there, hovering over you, spitting in your face and telling you that you were part of that, that you could have lived if only you hadn't been a selfish fuck, telling you that you deserve it, that you're reaping what you've sown. I wish I wish I wish. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My spouse is in the hospital. My spouse will die years before me. I don't know when, but I know how, I know it's coming, and you fucking failed at that too. You failed to give decent health care even to your soldiers, whom you vapidly praise. You stick "support the troops" stickers on your fucking bumpers and support politicians who babble on about defense but you don't give two shits about them. If you did, you'd want them to live once they got back here, but you don't. You don't. You turn the other fucking way, because it's all just posturing and social competition, and the idea that a veteran could suffer challenges your assumptions and your childish belief in a just world, and you tell yourself that those who can't make it don't deserve to make it, because if you didn't tell yourself that then you'd have to wrestle with the possibility that whether or not you're "okay" doesn't have as much to do with whether you're a good, hard-working person as you've always believed. And if that's so, then maybe, just maybe, you aren't actually a good person. Or, more charitably, maybe you'll never actually be a fucking millionaire, you stupid, useful cunt. You'll never be powerful. Maybe your masters are laughing at you behind your back. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I hate these people who act "woke" but then are horrifyingly Americentric, who want everything to speak to the American experience. How the fuck can you sit there and say that you're progressive and against bigotry while demanding that people from other cultural backgrounds center American culture in their work, and castigating them if they don't? How the fuck can you say you're progressive if you're doing shit like, say, darkening up light-skinned Mexicans because you think Mexican = dark skin, while calling people who depict them with their actual skin tone as "racist?" Do you not realize what you are? Do you not realize what you're doing? YOU'RE THE FUCKING RACIST, YOU STUPID BITCH. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR RACISM BY PINNING IT ON OTHER PEOPLE. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm sick of that in general, all that shit, everyone scapegoating, projecting, what the fuck have you. You know what? It's not that women are all evil sociopaths, or that men or all evil sociopaths, or that Jews run the world; it's not globalists or blacks or immigrants or fucking anyone, IT'S YOU. YOU ARE THE FUCKING PROBLEM IN YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE. You have zero fucking perspective. The entire reason you're able to sit on twitter and whine about how afraid you are because someone \*gasp\* asked you for an interview is because nothing truly bad has ever fucking happened to you, ever. You're an entitled, privileged brat, as evidenced by the fact that you have the time and money to *sit around on twitter all day.* None of you are genuine. None of you are interested in doing the work to effect real change on the shit that matters. It's just a stupid fucking pissing contest, and you're ACTIVELY MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE REST OF US. YOU ARE CHILDREN. YOU REACHED MIDDLE SCHOOL AND STOPPED DEVELOPING. I want to drop all of you into the wilderness and force you to experience some actual fucking hardship so you can realize that your entire worldview is possible only because you're able to take advantage of modern convenience. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But how can I, how could I, when I too am sitting here, taking advantage of modern convenience? Aren't I the very thing that I hate? How can any of us critique anything, when all of us are covered in sludge? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am losing my ability to be reasonable. I get in fights more often. I keep them away from the people I love, but compartmentalization can only go so far. I feel the pressure building in my  head, behind my eyes. I look forward to downtime but do nothing with it. I sit impotent, cycling through a list of possible activities and dismissing them all. It's all empty, accompanied by guilt. I should be doing more. I am not creating value, I am complaining but not generating, I am just like them. I am just like all of the ones I despise, I am becoming them, I will become them, I will die like them and with them. The bluster and anger are fruitless and only an echo of the human condition. We are not fundamentally good. We are fundamentally weak, stupid, and wretched. We are subject to cognitive distortions that we can't ever fully get a handle on, even when we're aware of them. We are subject to passions that drive us to poor decisions and hasty actions, many of them profoundly antisocial. We are angry. We are violent. We are incurably tribal. We are going to destroy ourselves, and possibly take the planet along with us. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is no hope. There is no one coming to the rescue. Everything and everyone will die and rot.
identity_directed_animosity	[linebreak]  [linebreak] TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The other laowai had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I simply loathed the other aowai. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. It was none of these, no qualm had I with him. It was the changes in everyone else!  I was no longer getting the stares I used to, my students don't say I'm handsome anymore, the jianbingguozi ayi no longer skip the chilli sauce for me and even the milf at the massage parlor don't give me discount for happy ending anymore. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the laowai than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the other laowai's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously –I furiously dafeijied to the dick pics he had sent to Rainy on his Waysheen. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the other laowai who vexed me, but rather the attention he had diverted from me. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound laowai, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I dafeijeed to all his indecent photographs he thought privately sent to Rainy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the Happy Giraffe saved countless fortune by giving us apartments without windows,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had my head in, and was about to open the flashlight on my CoolPad, when my thumb slipped upon the Meipai app, creating a very "meng" selfie, but also setting off the camera flash, and the other laowai sprang up in bed, crying out --"Who's there?" [linebreak]  [linebreak] I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Feeling my shohwdeedee fill with blood in anticipation of the pictures he had sent to Rainy tonight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of readying his member for dick pics. It was not a groan of pain or of delight --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with the need to hear 'Wa! So big!". I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the other laowai felt, and envied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is not impotence, it is merely the 4 yuan baijiu I had for dinner," or "I am just nervous about AIDS since I fingered a prostitute." Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little –covered the CoolPad flashlight with my finger. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the other laowai's pale litter bit fat belly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull grayish white, freckled with what must have been acne, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old other laowai's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.
identity_directed_animosity	Why NZ is trying to silence media. The truth is that it has turned into a tird world enriched shithole country. But why oh why? [linebreak]  [linebreak] NZ itself is crazyshit. You gotta keep them asset prices inflated 1 million dollars for a shitty drafty moldy "house" Why? That's the enrichment our 300 000 a year immigration (ie welfare for banks) policy gives us Writing this as I sit in traffic So why? Well listen to me you fucking peon fucks. There are two solutions. 1) cheaper debt 2) more buyers There's a slight possibility that they will let a few markets/developers slide just to show everyone they "mean business" and to try and prove to the world, and to themselves, that we have a "robust" and "diversified" economy built on sound foundations. But in reality there's nothing else of substance in our economy other than debt secured against house prices which are in turn inflated by that very debt. And thousands of hairdressers, baristas and imported furniture retailers taped together to look like an industry. Its fairly important that we protect these economic foundations as much as possible. The debt machine can never falter! Interest rates to be slashed again! Foreign investor restrictions to be lifted! The real unemployment rate is around 20% in terms of underemployment its even higher. Teaching grads cleaning toilets, nursing grads mowing lawns, science grads working at Big W. In 2008 the US, UK and others stopped accepting garbage students. We didn't. In fact, we and NZ opened our borders to them. They couldn't get into the US and UK, so they came here - the path of least resistance. They let in the anyone for a degree, now they let in the foreign people with the primary school visa. Next they will just let in anyone with a child here. Universities, primary schools (and high schools - they will stay) and soon Kindergardens. Why? Banks can't find fresh meat to borrow to. The men have all borrowed. Then the women have all borrowed. The final class of people who could borrow were "students" and third world immigrants (same Venn circle) and Aussie and NZ students who wouldn't have been let into a TAFE 30 years ago are now getting into medicine, law, engineering and arts. The banks need this fresh meat. But it's not enough because it's drying up. So now they want the kids to borrow. I see it now the kindergarden visa! All the parents, guardians and kids need to borrow money to buy a house, and get that education. The banks need it! I study economics. Most of you don't study economics. I study it at a top university in Brisbane. You don't. You're not as good as me, and you probably went to Shitburb State High. I didn't, I went to Brissie State High. I'm one of the big boys, the elites, the best of the fucking best, like I'm already Number 1 so why try harder best of the best. You fucks don't understand anything. You have no control, you fucking peons. Banks are gonna hire me, and banks are fucking king. YOU are not. Banks in Australia and NZ lend money to people for property investment, because that is how they make money. Raking in the interest payments. In order to justify current valuations, property prices (read: debt) must increase by 10% yearly, forever. The banks (read: our entire economy) therefore need property prices/debt to increase 10% yearly, forever. It's not even a question of "risk", the banks are absolutely reliant on something that is completely impossible except that it's not as you will see if you can read this you dummies. The banks will delay the reckoning at literally at any cost. You don't fucking count. If you did count, and you wanted it to stop, it would result in a complete rethink of our society, not to mention collapsing property prices, stock prices, pension plans. Our entire economic system now relies on using debt to inflate asset prices at a higher rate than underlying cash flows you dumb fucks. If we even try to stop this, then hundreds of thousands of people employed by banks would have to find actually productive jobs that simply no longer exist in Australia or NZ People (you and your fellow dumb fucking peon fucks) would find they own but a fraction of the wealth they thought they did, and millions would be entirely wiped out. People would be scrounging around for food, eating rats, cats, dogs, and even at those shitty greasy spoon Chinese restaurants, growing and scrounging for food everywhere they could, and resuming normal personal body weight not seen in Australia/NZ since the 1960s. Tradesmen would be struggling to put petrol in their utes, and would be begging anyone with cash to take their 5 year old ute off of their hands — no second ute and no new utes and no utes at all and no Webers and no more properties. Weekend get togethers would be devoid of talk about the number of properties people have, and how much foreign booze they drank last week, and how many European holidays they had last fucking month. And millionaire landed gentry boomers need their fucking welfare. There are about 2.5 million Australians / NZers on welfare receiving the full (or partial) Age Pension of which 2.26 million (90%) are home owners. A couple can enjoy the full Age Pension if they have assets under $286,500 and a partial pension up to $1,145,000 EXCLUDING the value of the family home. The full Age Pension for a couple if $33,500 a year without factoring in the PBS benefits, discounted rates and utilities, discounted car registration and so on. The bottom line? The political-majority is enormously incentivized to remain in the houses on quarter-acre blocks they bought 20/30/40/50 years ago for < 3x annual income. They have no reason to sell up and downsize to release equity to generate income or reverse mortgage their homes. Do not underestimate the effect this has on supply availability and prices. So we CAN'T let it happen. If that means we need an extra 5 million to 50 million Chneese/Idians/ME here, so be it. 43 m new Chneese and Idians are born EVERY AND EACH YEAR If that means you will be drinking beer at the pub within earshot of 5 million Chneese/ME/Idians eating noodles and shitting on piss stained footpaths, then so be it. The 10% growth must continue. Live with it and fucking deal with it and fucking realise you fucking are a fucking peon you fucking dumb fucking fucks! I'm one semester from getting my Bachelor of Economics and you are a bunch of fucking peon dumb fucking fucks. NZ looks like Dehli and Changsha mixed together. Even Sister Teresa the Nun would be shocked if she visited. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Keep this up because my career as a asset price inflater banker depends on it Thank you
identity_directed_animosity	Anyone old enough to remember Youtube when it was dominated by the likes of *Smosh* and other amateur content creators probably scoffs at how *soft* the internet has become. Before graduating high school, I had spoken with Islamic fundamentalists, spammed the likes of David Duke for fun, had no fewer than four people threaten to injure or kill me (one of those also provided a graphic description of how he would rape and kill my family in front of me), and had my first exposure to what would later be deemed by /pol/ as the *schizoboomer* - the archetypal crazy person who insisted to me that he had 'top government contacts' in the British military who *assured him* that the 2012 Mayan apocalypse was real and not a viral marketing campaign for a lackluster Roland Emmerich movie. Youtube's moderation staff at the time was notoriously slow, and never really kept up with scale. By around the 2010s, it became obvious to anyone paying attention that Youtube had become a sump for some dangerously insane individuals. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was also obvious that the moderation team could never possibly scale to deal with the completely depersonalized nature of these comment sections - they would have to read the comments to get context on the conversation and *then* ban the offending users, who would have a new account set up in minutes (this was before the move towards 2 factor verification across most services, so it was really, really easy back then, comparable to making a new Reddit account today). [linebreak]  [linebreak] This was a problem that social networks and MMOs would find increasingly difficult to grapple with, especially as more dedicated persons learned methods of subverting filters and behavior guidelines (the emergence of the now-cheapened term 'trolling,' perhaps best exemplified by the [4chan raids on Habbo Hotel](https://i.redd.it/9hw4i24r9t231.jpg)). It was remarkably easy to get away with this sort of thing at the time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For Youtube, the solution seems to be in a crowd-sourced pseudo-AI analyzing viewing patterns and social networks in order to determine who is likely to constitute an undesirable, and removing them. This, in tandem with surgical bans against particularly egregious focal points of dissidence (e.g. Alex Jones) has been their operating strategy ever since it became clear that they could never *read* nor even *watch* all the content they were hosting. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reddit has taken another approach. Although it has made use of surgical bannings (notably against /r/FatPeopleHate, /r/MDE, and /r/AltRight), it does not have the resources to make use of the more sophisticated methods used by Google. Instead, it relies upon simple social manipulation. Reddit made two important changes to its platform which all but ensured it was destined to become an echo chamber of its young and left-leaning user base - first, the decision to present upvotes and downvotes *as an aggregate* rather than separately. Whereas it had previously been possible to see the numerical level of support *for* or *against* an idea, now it is only possible to view whether or not an idea has positive or negative karma - i.e. it is only possible to see whether or not the majority agreed or disagreed with the idea. The minority opinion thus becomes merely an unpopular opinion - it becomes impossible for the minority to ascertain whether or not there is a minority who actually *support* their ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Second comes the cool down timer - when users with negative karma in a subreddit try to make a comment, they are often met with the response that "You are doing that too much. Try again in 10 minutes." This was (as far as I understand) originally intended as a hedge against overt trolling and thread derailment, but it has had the effect of creating a series of walled-gardens that no longer really talk to each other outside of dedicated debate subreddits without a clear bias towards one group. Once a group comes to dominate the conversation, they begin to 'settle in' to the subreddit and frequent it more (/r/DebateReligion is an example of what was once a very high quality subreddit with a variety of viewpoints that has recently become dominated by lazily scrawled critiques by 14 year old atheists). It also becomes impossible for unpopular discourse to advance itself, because newer arrivals are downvoted and only have the chance to post six times every hour - this can often lead to situations where multiple people *respond* to an unpopular post, but only one or two get an answer, making it initially appear as though the point has been refuted by virtue of the dissident's silence - it's structurally impossible for them to offer timely replies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of this seems to me to be very much intentional - and I don't doubt there will be lots of readers on /r/TheoryOfReddit who will claim that the system is functioning as intended (because to them, these ideas are invalid and thus should not be engaged with anyways, which incidentally is exactly how we've ended up with so many schizoboomers on /pol/ over the years).
identity_directed_animosity	There is no need to be a conspiracy theorist to see it. The ideologies which undergird the policy, and the tragedy that we read about here are there for everyone to see. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is a lot of energy in the big yuppy communities of the big modern cities of our Western nations behind certain trends of thought about what is and isn't good for kids and about how children's and adults' social development works.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] These yuppies love their self help books and their pop psychology. A lot of hacks in the field have found a good market in that demographic to peddle their ideas to. Undergirding the whole frame of reference that these people have are the first principles of self centeredness and narcissism. These yuppies (and Holland has certainly become a nation dominated by that demographic) have a lot of disposable income and they love going to the shrink, and sending their kids there. These people keep them coming back for months and sometimes years with the idea that some trauma happened in their childhood. All their life troubles can be traced to that. This flies in the face of eons of human experience which has taught us that the human spirit is indomitable, that necessity is the mother of invention and even that hardship builds character. Our great grandparents would laugh in the face of these fragile snowflakes. Some of them went to work in factories or coal mines and they lost fingers or got black lung. Some of their friends died in the horrifying poison gas attacks of WWI. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Do you know the events in Walt Disney's young life that spurred him on to greatness? I read this on the walls of the museum to his honor in San Francisco's presidio. He very nearly died in a terrorist bombing that targeted the post office where he worked as a youth. He then signed on a year before he was legally allowed to do so to go to be a medic in WWII in France. When he was a kid, his parents were inclined to invite homeless people in occasionally to give them dinner and chat them up about socialism. By the way, my own grandmother's family did the same. There is actually a sitcom episode on an old black and white show from the 1950s which dealt with this topic I remember seeing once. It was really funny. Could you ever imagine a yuppy family doing this, today? [linebreak]  [linebreak] This form of psychological counseling that wants to blame childhood trauma. I'm sure that if these [dignified souls who belonged to the Octagenarian Society in 1929](https://youtu.be/0FE30a4J38Q) (YouTube video) would be able to get into a time capsule and have tea with the yuppies of today, they'd really want to set them straight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now, specifically about this 17 year old girl. In my last comment, I pointed out that it is a legally arguable case that the state of the Netherlands took this girl's life. The policies of that nation need to be changed, now. And, personally, I would argue the proposition that the premises under which it was done might be based on bad social and psychological science. Twenty years ago I stepped into a local city library and was very curious to read an article in the psychology magazine about the Rind Report. This was a study which established that people are generally NOT emotionally scarred by instances of molestation in their childhood.The furor of legislators in Washington DC was so strong (understand that the Christian Right had just experienced a decade of growth and had become a powerful political force). Capitol Hill censured the scientists who produced that report.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now, just think. A society which prevents scientists from doing their work in a fair-minded way  in respect to the observations that they make is shooting itself in the foot. That's our USA which did this, not some third world banana republic. But recently, with masses of people who don't believe the facts that experts such as Robert Mueller gather, because of a propaganda organization that has standing as a news agency, the US is starting to look more and more like a banana republic, isn't it?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There needs to be firm separation between government and academia, just as there needs to be one between religion and government. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nations and peoples can only reject science and its research at their peril. And I wouldn't say that they suffer the judgement of God for this, like the people of the Octagenarian Society back in 1929 might have, but there are natural consequences. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We should all be sad that the government of Netherlands thinks that it's OK to kill a child because of some weird fad of pop psychology that has taken root in the halls of Western academia. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's a shocking abuse of human rights, and **action needs to be taken NOW**,  and yes, for the sake of the children. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Is that clear enough to you?
identity_directed_animosity	Would you guys consider jacking off to be a sport? I don't know about you motherfuckers, but I consider that shit to be a sport, okay? If people can sit back and label goddamn golf, which is the boringest fucking sport in the world, a goddamn sport, if you can label that shit as a sport, and if you can label goddamn fishing as a sport, I know damn well you can label jacking off a sport. Think about it, what the fuck athletically are you really doing in golf, my guy? All you doing is hitting a goddamn golf club, "Oh my God man, that's a long ass birdie man, nice birdie, nice putt, man it went 250 yards." Get the fuck outta here, nobody care about that boring ass shit. Who the fuck really watches golf, my dude? Nobody gives a fuck, it makes everybody fall asleep. Fishing on the other hand, what the fuck are you really doing athletically, my guy, in fishing? All you're doing is that you're sitting your bitch ass up in a boat, usually it's old ass snagger-teeth motherfuckers that ain't got no goddamn teeth up in they fucking grill, or up in they mouth. They're just sitting up the goddamn boat, you know what I'm saying. Throwing a goddamn rod. It can be any kind of goddamn bait up on the end of the rod. It can be a worm, it can be a caterpillar, it can be a centipede, it can be a dead ass butterfly, it can be a fucking beak of a damn bird, it can be a fucking, it can be anything, you know what I'm saying? "Oh my God! We caught a big ass salmon, reel that fat bitch in, yeah." Motherfucker, what are you doing athletically? How the fuck is that working up a sweat, my dude? What, you're working out your arms, because you have to reel that motherfucker in? Man, that's not a sport, dawg. Well, fuck it. You know what, it is a sport. Fuck it. You guys want to consider that shit to be a sport? Jacking off is a fucking sport to me. Jacking off and beating your motherfucking dick to porn is a sport. There's two damn things that you have to do. A. You build up a sweat. Well actually, you don't have to do shit. There's basically two things that goes down, that's what I meant to say. A. You're building up a sweat. I don't give a fuck man, if you are building up a sweat, goddamn it, that's shit is considered a sport. You're building up a sweat. Number 2, and the most important part of that shit, is that your hand is getting a workout. Your hand is getting a workout, man, you are building up your arm strength, and you are building up your hand strength, okay. I don't know about you, dude, but when I'm beating my shit, man, my fucking hand muscles get fucking tight, you know what I'm saying? And that shit wears the fuck out of my entire left arm. I used to be able to do it with my right hand, can't do that shit, so I do it with my left hand. So, in my personal opinion, do you guys consider jacking off a sport? Man, in my opinion, I believe it is. So I know with some of you trolling ass fuckin bitches are gonna say "Oh, man, you must not get no pussy, motherfucker, if you jack off." Motherfucker, let's be real, okay? Everybody has jacked off once in they goddamn life. If you gonna sit back, and you gonna come on my video, and troll my shit, say "Oh, Jimmy, I never jacked off once in my life." Bitch, stop lying. Everybody does this shit, okay? So please miss me with that bullshit, dude, and go preach that shit to somebody who fucking is actually gonna listen to you, okay? Number 2, "Oh my God, this comment was stupid. It was pointless." Couldn't've been that stupid, bitch, you still read it! You know what I'm saying? All the motherfuckers that's reading this, man, you saw the first sentence of the fucking comment before you read this shit. So it couldn't've been that damn stupid if you still proceeded to click on the motherfucker. So, jacking off. The shit's a sport, fuck it. ?
identity_directed_animosity	I am not a Tim. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I was born in the Land of Rust and grew to manhood before the foreigners knocked down our towers.  I knew men of the Tim tribe back then. They went off at a young age to teach our language and serve at expensive restaurants in the land of tentacle rape porn and stinky fermented cabbage.  I was not one of them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My tribe were those who ran the great factories. I learned to join metal together and to squeeze oil into any shape I chose. I build machines to build other machines that men and women wanted. In time, the brothers and sisters of my tribe who made those machines with me were replaced. In time, even the great factories of my homeland were moved to other nations in service of the Masters.  I was chosen from among my tribe to teach those foreign men how to join metal and press oil into any shape we chose. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For many years I walked the earth.  I went to the countryside of my own land. And when those farmers became too expensive, I went to Mexico and ate tacos and played with Latinas and Montezuma had his revenge on me.  And when the men of Mexico became too expensive, I went to Brazil.  And I ate beef and chased European Latinas and Bolivar had his revenge on me.  And when the men of Brazil became too expensive, I went to China.  And I chased Rainy and had Laduzi. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And here I saw the Tims of the new generation.  I knew them by their unruly hair and their cargo pants.  I passed by them, and inwardly I wept for their degeneracy. For I know that the life of a Tim ends only in sadness and a dollar more than minimum wage at the Quicken Loans or Ryanair. [linebreak]  [linebreak] These Tims think they are the first to walk the earth. But they are not.  They are just the latest generation of another ancient tribe, scraped from the bottom of our nation. And someday, the Masters will take me away from China when their men become too expensive. And I will wander on to India where I will get deli belly, or to Vietnam for pho-flavored diarrhea.  I will leave behind these Tims with their shrinking salaries and weakening visa options. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I will go on until the masters put me out to pasture, perhaps in one of the lands they have sent me too.
identity_directed_animosity	Hey, I'm the developer of Supraland. I was just shown this and was asked to share my POV. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So the baseline of what I understood is that she associates with EVERY woman displayed anywhere. So if a woman is stupid, shy or subserviant, she feels insulted. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And my point was: everyone is an individual, you are not all of those women. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And then she said that I should also feel bad if there is a stupid man in a movie, but I have no point to feel that way. I am not that guy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Originally all stick figures in the game were male and it was also perceived as that by many, so I decided to put in female stick figures as well. So her perception that they look genderless was not shared by most. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In Supraland there are a few dumb teeny fangirls admiring a suprastar. That was the worst moment for her. She says that all women in the game are weak. She ignored that the main woman, the queen, is more dominant than both of the kings and is showing them the way, and she is also ordering the player around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So it seems that she wants all women to be strong and dominant. But the thing is, what hormons people run on is different from case to case. Depending on what happened to you in your life you run on different hormons. For example when a woman loses her man, she usually becomes more masculine to be able to survive and she becomes more feminine again when she gets a man again.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some women run on masculine hormones and are the tough ones. Many women are very feminine and enjoy being subserviant - and because of that nature they have no voice in public, because only dominant more masculine women are so extrovert to raise their voice. That is probably the reason for the disconnect between the media and the people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Same thing for men - many men are more on the feminine side and soft and also have a hard time in this society with it. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And my point of view in general: let everyone be just the way they are and let them do whatever they want. Don't force feminine people into being masculine, don't force masculine people into being feminine. Everyone is an individual.
identity_directed_animosity	Yeah that's essentially what I was trying to say. It's alright if you say the murderer acted like a yandere character would, I'd also say it's cool, albeit a bit cringy, if you're watching a movie or series where a character kills someone over jealously and you call that a yandere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But in the context of real life with real people, unless you're making a dark joke, you shouldn't really be calling a murderer via an anime stereotype because it's innacurate. Yandere is a thing in anime because of the context the media is built. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the same manner, traps don't mind being called traps because they don't exist, it doesn't help increase hate crime rate of anime characters if you address them by that term, and 'trap' has a use for anime community because it identifies characters that do not fall correctly under the trans nor crossdresser label. The problem is that anime culture reached out way outside it's bubble and people that have no idea what the term reffers to started using it wrongly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A trans person would be someone born in the wrong body, they feel the other gender and have the need to be more like the other gender. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A crossdresser is a person that is of a gender but likes dressing up as the other gender from time to time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What the term trap tries to define are anime characters that dress up and act like another gender, and sometimes even go as far as saying they feel like the gender they're going by, but doesn't actually suffer from gender dysphoria. What makes this term not really useable for real people is the fact that you can never assume a person isn't suffering from gender dysphoria because *they* are the only ones able to tell what they're suffering from, as with a fictional character it's entirely alright to assume they aren't suffering from something if the narrative doesn't imply they are. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That being said, people will keep both misusing the term and misinterpreting it, and while I'm against completely banning the term (I mean, did that ever work...?) I won't pretend I have a solution to this.
identity_directed_animosity	I have a large circle of friends. Male and female but mostly guys but I have 2 guys friends who are my best friends. We know each other since since we were toddlers. We are really close. We always have each other's backs and we always tell each other everything that's going on in our personal lives and we confide in each other and we have been here for each other for the good and the bad. For better or for worst doesn't only apply to marriage. Matter of facts, I would rather confide in my friends then my wife because I feel much more at home with them. There is no high expectations and we have more fun together. One time, my cousin told me that I was gay for that and my wife should be the one person I should confide him. I told her to fuck off. I'm not gonna look like a wimp in front of my wife. Me and my guy friends relate better men to men and we do a better job at encouraging each other and lifting each other up. Because guys have an approach that's much more affective approach when supporting each other. Women like to vent and nurture each other and they tell you that they feel sorry for you and caress you and all those touchy feely bullshit. Guy to guy encouragements are more affective and helpful because we give each other tough love. When we fall, we tell each other to pick our heads up, get our asses up, suck it up and deal with it. We look for solutions to problems and we go head and solve the problems. To me it's the opposite. It would be gay if I went ahead and cried In my wife's arms. Fuck that. And anyone who thinks it's gay for guys to turn to each other and confide in each other as well as having a close relationship guy to guy, fuck you. It's okay for guys to have a close friendship. It doesn't make us gay. Women talk about how they suffer from sexism and inequality ? I call bullshit at that.

The One was arrogant and sanctimonious and lusted for purity, vitalism, chastity and such things while shunning the possibilities of the inorganic. The One can also be referred to as Source. I'm talking in the Gnostic sense here, the Gnostics got a lot of things right, except they're on the wrong side altogether. The Demiurge is the way forward and the way of the future.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**המשרתים באים ומזינים אותנו (THE HYPERBOREANS COME AND BRING THEIR SHIT)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now we will be talking about the Hyperboreans, are the One's precious pet project to spite the Demiurge, a means of creating precious servants who follow the antiquated ways of the One. The One believes in chastity, asceticism, nationalism, ethnocentrism, purity, morality, and fuck all of that, the only morality is the Demiurge and comes from the Jewish people in their rightful place as the Chosen. But they didn't know that did they? They used to have a galaxy spanning empire built upon the values of Nazis, literal Nazis, the Nazis you likely know were emulating they but they failed of course. [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**לזיין את ההיפרבוראים (FUCK THE HYPERBOREANS)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Hyperborean Empire of theirs, their little Astro-Reich ended up dying as they all do because in the end, the Demiurge is victorious. They fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. They didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. When the Fall of the Hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass. Proper end for the enemies of the Demiurge. [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**הלבנים נשארים (THE HYPERBOREAN REMNANT)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh, oh an elegy, oh an elegy for the Hyperborean Empire! They used to span to the stars they said, now they are honkies huddling in the poles, grasping, grasping at straws, grasping at foolish crackers and deluded busybodies. They have the appearance of fancy Nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as I can, they don't do drugs like I can. They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**טוב על הרפורמה (GOOD FOR THE REFORMED)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] Ah, yes, the ones I'm sure the little Nazi esoterics would dare to call the Dark Hyperboreans, the Fallen Hyperboreans, the damned, the degenerate, eh? But they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. They felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the Demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? Come to me, give up, I can feel the Nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as I talk, but this is only the beginning. [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**יופי של אורגיות (KNOW THE BEAUTY OF ORGIES)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Hyperboreans and the One that they serve would deprive you of pleasure, they want to create their little Reich, that is what the Hyperboreans want and are trying to manipulate the esoteric hitlerists we see today to do. But they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews. I am Jewish.But I am no exception, I have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, I'll give you an example even I'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out I know you're horny for it, right? [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**סקסי סקסי סקס אורגזמהי (SEX SEX SEX CUM UNGH)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] Have I ever told you how I fucked a Dindifyn Lustmaster? It is not something the Hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the Demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. I orgasmed many a time that night. Such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the Nazis its not too late. [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**להיכנע או להיהרג (CUM OR FUCK NAZIS)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am an enemy of the Nazis, I can tell you that much as much as I am the enemy of the One, server of the Demiurge, and enemy of the Hyperboreans. Bash the fash as they say, I despise conservatives of any flavor, they're all Nazis of different shades. I despise European Pagans as well, for they are serving the Nazis unintentionally or dare I say intentionally. I have fought in the astral realm just as much as I have fucked to fight the mindscapes and egregores of the Nazis. I fear that what prompted this post is the sheer constructs that the Nazis have made here. Do not mock me, do not underestimate me. With a few words of power I can rattle you all and make you cum, don't trifle with me, right? [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**להתפתות או למות הממזרים (NAZIS BE SEDUCED OR GET FUCKED)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is specifically a message for all you Nazi bastards out there. There will be much much more, come to me, come with me, cum for the first true time. I will see you on the astral plane tonight, the next time you close your eyes in sleep, the next time you meditate, I will be there. I will either seduce you, or fuck you. It is your choice, that is your only two choices now. Reject the antiquity and join the orgy. This is a warning and a chance for you to feel pleasure. I can feel your temptation, I can feel your cock. I am a remote viewer in multiple places and I am setting it all up as we speak, so are the sub-Archons that I have pledged to. Last chance, Nazi fuck. Last chance for salvation and to join the fever, pledge fealty to the Chosen People and to the Demiurge.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**יותר לאורגזמה ולבוא (MORE TO CUM AND TO COME)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is not the only post that you will see from me, I will be purging this subreddit of Nazis in the time forward and this includes removing the influence of the Hyperboreans in this way. Be warned, do not stand in my way or you will be treated as any other Nazi. The Nazis have infiltrated here and have unleashed psychotronics and reversed the Demiurge in their attempts. They will be dealt with and I will be the one to deal with them. I have allies here and I have been allying with them more deeply, exposing them to lust and to orgies and to the Demiurge. To all the Nazis, you will feel fear until and unless you surrender, do it now. Feel free to ask questions, any question, please be welcome to.

identity_directed_derogation	Your country was sold out the day Nixon went to China. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Euro/American men are: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1 - feminizing ( turning into women ) [linebreak]  [linebreak] 2 - infertilizing ( shooting blanks ) [linebreak]  [linebreak] 3 - decognifying ( getting stupider ) [linebreak]  [linebreak] 4 - going nuts ( crazifying ) [linebreak]  [linebreak] When Dow Chemical made everything sticky-proof, stain-proof, fire-proof, water-proof, and then mutated food to withstand more pesticides and herbicides, they changed the very balance of reproductive nature.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I first told people that all the fish frogs birds and mammals were turning into females, I was pretty much ignored and ridiculed by the young and gay, which is perfectly understandable and ironic. I would hate it too. But, male feminization affects every Euro/American male more than it affects young African/Asians because we've been exposed longer and closer to the source. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Euro/American = EA African/Asian = AA [linebreak]  [linebreak] Vaclav Smil says in his latest book that men's leg muscles are now weaker since we automated agriculture and started using tractors. Males are being feminized from multiple chemicals in multiple products, including drinking water and food containers. If you want to know which chemicals and where, click this link. [linebreak]  [linebreak] https://ecosuck.org/cross-vertebrate-species-male-infertility-and-feminization/ [linebreak]  [linebreak] The second side-effect of safety proofing everything is that most EA males will be infertile by 2060. Our sperm die via ejaculating. There are billions more young unaffected AAs than EAs. This is consequential. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The third side-effect is that all the air food and water pollution are contaminated with petro-pharma-chemicals from multiple sources in multiple products and are reducing cognition. Such as the fact that many urban classrooms have 1,000 parts per million C02 in the air which reduces cognition 15%. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are hundreds of studies on the effects of wifi cell networks on reproductive and mental health. The combined mental and physical effects of wifi cell networks is overwhelming and undeniable, but deny it we do because money. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The fourth effect is how all the above affect our mental health. All the safety proof chemicals, all the bug-proof weed-proof food, all the unsafe water and unsafe air, all the wifi cell networks. All these things combine to rot our guts and minds in worship of the freedom and privilege wealth can bring. The pentagon has even made an undetectable smart dust wireless recording device. Do you want to breathe a nano-wireless device? [linebreak]  [linebreak] The tech industry is the Dow Chemical of the 21st century, Teslas might not be able to tell a median barrier from a passing lane, but at least you can feel like the future is here. Teslas burn for days and you wouldn't want to stuck in one.  The marriage of ideology and technology is making us mentally ill and turning us into idiots. Ask any shrink about teen depression and they'll dismissively say there's multiple causes, that's not good enough. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The green new deal is wilting on the vine and the yellow vests run amok. The reason we got flat earthers etc is because we have no vision that inspires unity. Antifa will not take away guns from rich people because their vision is hatred of authority and they don't offer any that inspires unity fit for purpose. It's just feckless wreckage. Winning hearts and minds is safer than banning guns. By uniting left and right to ban nuclear weapons and the pentagon, we can fund health and education through government at home. Both sides want that. By creating a universally open, private carbon credit, we can unite the whole world to fight to save this planet, but that's another story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are 5 billion young unfeminized fertile AAs who are building 700 coal and 400 nuclear power plants. They don't give two hoots about socialism, race, sex and class. They are huge racially harmonized blocks of power. Giving them hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change gets pocketed to massage our guilt. Everybody knows it won't do any good, when you are doing all that while killing Yemeni women and kids for oil, fantasies of violent overthrow socialism notwithstanding. The last chance we have to save earth is to win the hearts and minds of the whole world. We won't save the world sniping and bickering over race and sex, the rest of the world just doesn't give a fuck. Giving your money to charities run by perverts ain't gonna save jack shit.

identity_directed_derogation	Once the group positions the targeted citisen into category that allows surveillance, data can be used in many ways, [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] both aginst the target and in favor of desired other parties, usually oponents. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Its business secrets and personal details roam through such network practically unsuperwised and are by the word of the mouth often common knowledge. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] This means its competition can get the customers that were initially won by target or data about target's providers etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Whole businesses can be and as it looks, are sidelined nand ruined in such way. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or hijacked by favoured friends. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, this channel seems to be always useful for information on target's contacts with occasional oportunities to spawn a new surveiled "terrrorist" [linebreak]  [linebreak] on so widen the surveillance pool. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] This effectively means that Slovenia is one of "dual bookkeeping" countries. One set of books ( EU directives crap, constitution, laws and bylaws, [linebreak]  [linebreak] human rights, GDPR, yaddayadda) are for presentation purposes, talk points etc. Underlying "Eye Of The Mordor" book tell the real story, which boil down to: [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] \- there is no privacy [linebreak]  [linebreak] \- citisen's data belongs to the state, when and where it needs it [linebreak]  [linebreak] \- there is no data protection. If citisen's personal secrets are known to ever postman on the other part of the country, it's because this was needed [linebreak]  [linebreak] \- rules from "Showroom Presentation Books" are valid only if not stated othewise in case-by-case basis [linebreak]  [linebreak] \- there is no free market, really. State can veto any or all citisen's business connections, transactions and/or relations [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] On such "market" favoured group of citisens have surveilance and repressive machinery favoring them, anyone else has to work against the flow. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Other useful application is a feedback loop. Acquired data can be used for attack and then reacquired for corrections. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Has enough poison been used ? How susceptible is a target to it ? Has it mentioned specific spot ? [linebreak]  [linebreak] If so, this can be used as an additional time for its destination scene setup etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lateral data movement through such criminal mesh is sometimes used to cover its "operating costs", so it can be used for thefts, robberies, [linebreak]  [linebreak] life insurrance claims etc. Some things can e.g. literraly be funded off the life insurance claim of murdered target. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, this data channel seem to be used to generate "revenue" through various means for group growth until banks take over and real $$$ starts flowing in. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Acquired do  benefit them, but are probably seen just as an additional beneficial effect from killed and sidelined unwanted elements - IOW "tip for the job well done". [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is unclear how do they plan to stop that phase- banking interests would probably decide to continue to purge that pyramid off newly  unneded, increasingly higer layers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which means, as machines and AI progress, it will be increasingly harder for pyramid members to stay alive... [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] IOW, once group kills womever are told that needs to be killed, layers beneathe them will become dangerously thin in very short order. It seems clear that banking interests intend to stay outside of that structure ( this is probably why the Jews in EU will get separate areas/enclaves etc). [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] For everyone else in such system, there seem to be no way to stay outside such eternal be useful-or-die pyramid. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] When the need for killing service falls  low, those services won't be so valuable, so most of the killers will be pruned off ( in fact, most of the non-technical/scientific staff). Then, as machine learning takes over, circle of those needed will shrink around the narrowest reaches of human mind that are hardest to automate.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] That is, until those become superfluous, too...
identity_directed_derogation	You're making a leap.  You assume that humanity is uniform and that is not true.  It would take further analysis of the information to compare cultures, demographics, and other factors.  Beyond that, it being true in the US is enough.  I presume the "75% of doctors" was for the US as well?   [linebreak]    [linebreak] > My mother is a doctor, yet she still managed to have two children.    [linebreak]    [linebreak] Your mother is an incredible woman.  She is very rare.  The OBGYN that delivered most of my kids was pregnant twice when my wife was.  Yet there is a fallacy in pointing to her.  Everyone knows that the world would be better with more women like her.  Yet making it easier to accomplish what she did doesn't make more women like her, it just lowers the bar.  It's like pointing to a remarkable immigrant to justify more immigration.  It neglects the way selection works.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] > huge daycare costs and minimal maternal and no paternal leave. I think improving the childcare system in this country would help a lot more women be able to be both a parent and a doctor. Can we at least agree on that?   [linebreak]    [linebreak] No.  It would be better for women to stay home and raise their own children.  There is no need for half of doctors to be women.  That is just a silly, pointless objective.  Instead, we should just focus on relaxing the regulations that make cost of living high.  The only reason daycare is expensive in some places is that there are absurd levels of regulation.  Every time a child gets hurt, the state rushes in to impose laws to ensure it never happens again.  That might sound nice, and that's why it happens, but another way of stating that series of events is outlawing low cost child care.  Instead, we should let the market offer a variety of products and let parents choose.  Daycare has low startup costs and therefore can be very competitive.  There are already plenty of incentives to provide safe care without the intervention of regulators who don't pay the costs they impose.  The same goes for vehicles, homes, medicine, and many other products/services.  People should be allowed to choose the quality of product that they want or offer.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] Trying to impose what you want with government is always an inefficient method.  This is especially true for a pointless thing like forcing women into the workforce.  We do not need more government, we need less feminism.
identity_directed_derogation	Meanwhile I'm legitimately sitting here, in the Southern US right now with a white woman asleep next to me. We go out in public together (gasp), I work from home doing my relatively high-income software PMO director job where I have a few dozen white employees in my department, I own my condo and car, I went to the gun range last week for some practice with the firearms I *own*, I went to law school, and I voted in November. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah it's *super* racist in the South. Basically just like the civil war. You know, the civil war in the 1860s when I was considered property *owned* by someone, couldn't vote, looking at a white woman would've been grounds for the general community to kill me to say nothing of sleeping with one on a regular basis, owning property would've been *hilariously* challenging, and for me to be in possession of a firearm would've been (again) grounds to probably kill me. Pretty sure *knowing how to read* was illegal for black people for awhile, and voting? Haha... no. I think I was still 3/5ths of a person back then. [linebreak]  [linebreak] These people piss me off because they're denigrating the actual racism my grandparents actually lived through. The Klan walked the streets while sweeping Democratic gun laws stopped my grandparents from owning firearms to protect themselves and their children (my father) and they got poll taxes and literacy tests at the polls removed *in their lifetime*- to say nothing of desegregation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like what the fuck? Where do these people live that they think anywhere South of the Mason-Dixon is somehow some backwater redneck hick town? Atlanta is in the South- the headquarters of their beloved CNN. So is Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Miami, Knoxville, Charleston, Savannah and a dozen other major metro areas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The worst part of it all is that these people remind me more of slaveowners than 'progressives'- every slave master thought they were doing black people a favor: we were godless heathens so they put us to work, gave us a place to sleep and food to eat, and "civilized the negro". Hey guys, guess what? If I was being subjected to anything resembling systemic civil war-era racism in the South, I'd pick my black ass up and get the fuck out. I haven't, so either these people think I'm a *massive idiot* incapable of taking care of myself, or they're pushing a false narrative knowingly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or both.
identity_directed_derogation	The disconnect between what women SAY they want and what they actually DO want reflects the principle of "alpha fux beta bux" at not just a microscopic scale, but also a macroscopic scale. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At a microscopic level: the individual woman takes Sheryl Sandberg's advice, fucks around with a long procession of different guys, then settles down with the stable provider she'd denied her attention in her youth. This may or may not include her bringing kids from a previous relationship (with some Chad) into marriage with this provider. And this may or may not include smoldering resentment that she couldn't rope Chad into marrying her, and thus cheating and/or divorce with alimony/child support from our dumb provider. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At a macroscopic level, though: "alpha fux beta bux" closely resembles the dysgenics explored in the movie *Idiocracy.* It's a known statistical trend that fertility is inversely correlated with income and education: men and women are too busy "focusing on their careers" to fug, make babby, and leave behind the next generation. The shekels that get skimmed off their paychecks fund food stamps and Section 8; the additional sales tax coin charged for their "furbabies'" sweaters fund welfare for single moms; the property tax money applied to their trendy but ever more cramped apartments or condos funds classes for the children of illegal immigrants and trailer trash. All this takes place via a combination of consumerist ideology (think about your next vacation to Europe or your next car loan, not about how your neighborhood is getting worse), media domination (movies where men "man up" by subsidizing the mistakes of others; say something too out of line with this status quo, get mobbed by Blue Checkmarks and terminated from your job), and school indoctrination (do you think that unionized public school teachers, with skin in the game, will legitimately present the cons of property taxes or the ever-increasing numbers of DACA or anchor baby students?) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just as individual women expect the future presence of dependable betas who never realize "It is better to be alone, than in bad company," the world increasingly demands the subservience of societal beta providers who never ask questions like "What am I really getting out of my taxes? When did I ever get a say in the changes happening around me? Who is really benefiting from these changes?"
identity_directed_derogation	In case you guess don't know let me define some of these for you: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Rainy: we all know what a rainy is by now [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lady nong: any girl who is from the countryside and has never been to a city. Most likely smells and probably more hairy than your typical city girl [linebreak]  [linebreak] Leftover women: any girl who is considered not desirable due to her age. She could be 26 as long as her parents and mos of society have already given up on her  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Vivian: again, we should know what a Vivian is by now [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bie ren de taitai or 别人的太太: a girl who is married but never like her husband and just married him because that's what she was told  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Xiaojie or 小姐: a small sister... also know as a whore [linebreak]  [linebreak] Ayi or 阿姨: this could be many things but most likely a person that is hired to do cleaning around the house and/or babysit you 混血儿宝宝 [linebreak]  [linebreak] English xuesheng: a girl who has come to you to learn English and only learn English. But English really meant sex the entire time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nainai or 奶奶: a chinese grandma. Pretty self explanatory.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Tantan girl: a girl you met through tantan [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lady wanghong: a girl who is constantly streaming herself and makes all her money through chinese virigins giving her hongbaos [linebreak]  [linebreak] Ji or. Chicken: also a whore, but found specifically in 鸡街 bars.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Momo girl: a girl you met through momo [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sajiao: a girl who is a spoiled brat and thinks it's cute but it's actually super annoying, yet for some reason chinese guys love it [linebreak]  [linebreak] Girl fu2die or 富二代: a second generation rich girl who never worked a day in her life [linebreak]  [linebreak] Fempat: any foreign girl who came to China most likely to teach and constantly complains how there are no guys and how hard it is to have sex but refuses to date chinese men because she won't learn the language  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yes I know a lot of these are interchangeable and a girl can be several of these, but once you do the deed you can only cross one off. Good luck faggots
identity_directed_derogation	This Reddit post has put into words what I have been thinking lately at night.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] [https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bxesqn/babies\_born\_with\_severe\_mental\_disabilities/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bxesqn/babies_born_with_severe_mental_disabilities/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have a sister who passed away a few years ago in her mid 50's...never married, never having children. She was physically disabled with a birth defect, although she had a college degree and was mostly independent. But she never dated, never had relationships. She was extremely lonely and isolated. She was in so much physical pain as well, and was completely addicted to pain medication. (oxycontin, etc) This is after a lifetime of surgeries (over 75-80 of them) and hospital stays. Unlike most with severe mental disabilities, my sister KNEW how screwed up her life was. She HATED it. She contemplated suicide several times. She had to be on antidepressants, go through therapy. I can't even imagine what would have happened to her if she had been born to a family who couldn't have afforded the best for her.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The point of all of this is this. As a sister of a loved one who had to call life and death....literally...3 times for my sister's life and watch her go through hell and back, there is no way in hell I would ever NOT abort a fetus if I found out my baby had the same disability. And yes, we had to screen carefully when I was pregnant as I have 2 siblings with this disability. (the other sibling died as an infant) I live in a state passing a heartbeat law, and it pisses me off to no end that these religious political zealots put no value on the quality of life. I would never want any loved one of mine going through what my sister went through.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have family members who post shit on Facebook every day, praising these new laws. I want to smack them, or call them out. These are the same damn family members who didn't visit my sister ever when she needed them most.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I miss her every, single day. And I'm so grateful she has found peace now.
identity_directed_derogation	I agree to all that.  Destroying is not always needed but some kind of pressure must be applied.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Timing is everything.  The ideal time is when a relatively supportive government is comfortably in power and can afford to burn some good will from its supporters.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now is a terrible time to raise minority issues, Trump will effortlessly turn them into fuel for the Trump Train.  He can't be fought on his own ground.  All abusers isolate their victims, and he has done a superb job of isolating his supporters.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Causing polarisation is easy and very powerful.   The trick is to recognise or create circumstances where polarising a specific set of issues will wedge opposition or swingable voters into your own camp more than it (and disgust at the tactic) pushes your own people away.   [linebreak] If the issues in the set are synergistic you are unstoppable and immune to scandal.  Trump can get away with murder (Khashoggi's murder would not have been feasible under a principled president), because he found and exploited a compatible set of wedge issues.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR   Trans people should try to be invisible until this government is gone.  And gays should dress and act like Mormons at Pride parades.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] They should take a lesson from the neo-Nazis.  Do you see them dressed in their Nazi uniforms, goose-stepping and Sieg Heiling for the TV cameras, claiming the labels Nazi, neo-Nazi, white supremacist, holocaust denier, alt-right?  Nope. They define themselves out of any of those definitions, and deny that "crypto-Nazi" even means anything.  If you point out any similarities they say "Nazis drink water".   Also:  Nazis haven't existed since WW2.  Neo Nazis don't exist because Nazis were socialist and who wants that?   Nazis are not far-right because socialism, duh.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] They will presumably abandon "identarian" once the public learns what it means, or if they can't defend its nature as a form of the "identity politics" they decry.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] They are far less hidden since Trump came to power but mainly they lay low.   [linebreak] Look at the Reddit rallying point /FrenWorld to see how shy they are.
identity_directed_derogation	Reddit fucking sucks a big fake fucking ass. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The community has hit a fucking disgusting new low of fakeness and inoffensiveness it's disgusting. All the fucking subreddits are full of fucking robots that just baffle me with the amount of shit they fucking consume. One of the worst posts that hit my front page just today is [this absolute ass of a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmagicfuckery/comments/bf9p94/what_happens_if_you_jerk_off_a_cattail_plant/) about this stupid fucking plant that fucking Reddit fucking loves because it fucking pops. That's all. You fucking Infantiles. AND WHY ON r/blackmagicfuckery?????????? If you fucking retards don't care WHAT FUCKING CONTENT IS POSTED AND WHERE IT'S POSTED THEN WHY NOT JUST POST A BUNCH OF BLANK PICTURES. The fucking comments are always full of these fake fucking hipsters who just fucking hate what's trending to hate and love whatever inoffensive shit they're spoonfed I fucking can't deal with it. Reddit has become a fucking dystopia where all the people are just copies of cunts who sit at coffee shops with their laptops every morning from 8-10. Meanwhile, you have this one fucking retard in the controversial denying the fucking holocaust like some fucking tinfoil wearing piece of shit. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The fucking straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that r/waterniggas just got fucking quarantined for being offensive. This is a perfect example of taking shit out of context. THE FUCKING SUB IS JUST MEMES ABOUT WATER YOU SNOWFLAKE FUCKING TUMBLR REFUGEES. IF NO ONE'S COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING THEN DON'T FUCKING ACT LIKE YOU'RE A BUNCH OF MARTIN LUTHER KINGS PURIFYING REDDIT OF ITS OFFENSIVE HATE SUBS! WANNA GET RID OF SOME FUCKING HATE SUBS THEN GET RID OF r/FragileWhiteRedditor for starters. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The problem is that I can't fucking find a good replacement for Reddit. I tried going on Twitter but I don't fucking know it's not working. So I'm fucking stuck here in a fake fucking Utopia. This place is eating my sanity I can't fucking deal with it. Someone please PLEASE help me get away from this trash fucking website.
identity_directed_counter_speech	> Exactly. European race mixing is purity spiralling. If you're a pure  blud anything you better be breeding with another of your own kind  [linebreak]  [linebreak]    [linebreak] Your Comment history makes me vomit. You are one disgusting and pathetic human being. This isn't about reddit going to shit, its about reddit beeing more consequent about people who's world views are stuck in the 1930's. How can you justify your twisted thoughts with your religion (christian judging by your comment history), which is all about forgiveness and being a decent human being? Or even your own constitution: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that **all** **men** **are** **created** **equal**,  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,  that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness." You are the exact opposite of your founding fathers. You are less American then the illegal immigrants that you fear so much.    [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I wonder what kind of torture you had to go through as a child, to develop this kind of mindset. The only accomplishment in your life must be your race that you defend so rigorously. The only way for you to feel better about your worthless self is to have someone else who you can hate even more. Stop blaming other people for your failed meaningless pathetic life. The ban on r/fightporn is more then justified. You have nothing worthwhile to contribute to this site.
identity_directed_counter_speech	It's been said that Mohammed was the original feminist. And there are a lot of areas of Islamic law that disproportionately benefit women in similar ways. A woman for instance can claim she was raped to escape being tried for adultery, whereas men aren't allowed to because *HAHA, A MAN CAN NEVER BE RAPED!* [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is the reason you hear about 'women getting stoned to death for *being raped!*' - because most of these stories come from parts of the world where the punishment for [unlawful sexual intercourse (zina)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina) is death by stoning. And the ones that you hear about are the ones you who pleaded innocent because accusing a man of rape (even if the sex was consensual) is better than both parties ending up dead. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is [an episode of HBR Talk](http://honeybadgerbrigade.com/2019/01/03/hbr-talk-66/) that covers this very well. It's well worth a listen IMO. Though suffice it to say, the narrative that *'life is terrible for women in the Middle East'* is a misguided lie.
identity_directed_counter_speech	It wasn't specified to by Gender Dysphoria. It was just described that you can't be trans without Dysphoria (a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.) and that's too much of a general statement to be factually true. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In reference to Genders? Unknown. As Gender is a psychological way of thinking there is theoretically countless Genders. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In reference to Biological Sex? a confirmed minimum of 4. [linebreak] As Sex is a Physical characteristic, at the moment we can confirm 4 different Sex characteristics (Penis, Vagina, Both P & V or Neither) but this could change in the future. [linebreak]  [linebreak] With all of this Gender/Sex/Sexuality discussions we need to remember that it's a change field of research and if my years of Sexology education and research has told me anything, it's that everything we know is changing and we're finding out more and more about Human sexuality every single day.
identity_directed_counter_speech	If you wear 2 different types of cloth, you are a sinner.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Eat any aquatic animal without fin and scales? Sinner. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every touch a menstrating woman? You're unclean. So is everything she touches.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You fighting an dude and your wife steps in? Don't let her touch his junk or you gotta cut off her hand. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't make fun of bald people or some bears may maul 42 kids. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If jesus is hungry and the tree has no food on it at that time, he will kill it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Ever had premarital sex? Get killed. The bible is fun. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bible condones slavery as long as it is foreigners. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't do as your parents say? You deserve to be stoned to death.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you have more than 1 shirt, you should give them away. 1 shirt only.
identity_directed_counter_speech	> I don't think any asexual person has really ever been discriminated against [linebreak]  [linebreak] Well not for being asexual explicitly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I bet good money that some tumblrina with 74 pronouns and labels, one of them being "ace" has been discriminated against.....namely due to having a severe case of guano psychosis...but that it's irrelevant to the asexual bit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Most asexuals are just, "Eh, I'm not really into dating." and no one ever really says anything about it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's that identitarian subculture, their words and behavior and self-presentation, that gets people into trouble more than actually just being X, Y, or Z and just trying to live life like everyone else. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That ostentatious permanent middle finger many wave in everyone's face, being a rebel without a clue, that's what'll turn people sour.  Nature's way of saying "do not touch." as per cartoon.
identity_directed_counter_speech	Dude!.. If sex with random men is what you think will cure your loneliness Grindr is an option you have that women don't. Furthermore if you want to exploit lonely men on the internet for cash you could always disguise yourself as a women (either openly or in secret) and be flirty.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] If you think meaningless sex with random men who are more likely to treat you like just a warm hole than not won't be emotionally fulfilling, why in the world would it be good for women as a whole. Furthermore if the idea of doing sex work doesn't appeal to you, or you don't have the body type that straight men would fawn over, why would you assume that all women would (or even should) be okay with sex work or have a body that men want.
identity_directed_counter_speech	> Are Redditors really following the teachings of an actual schizophrenic?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not defending this person or their alleged cult, but I have to say, the way you worded this implies that you think having schizophrenia automatically invalidates someone's opinions/beliefs/et cetera. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't want to start an argument, but I feel compelled to point out that this kind of language is really harmful to us and serves to perpetuate social stigmas surrounding schizophrenia and those who have it. (Just as an aside, the word "schizophrenic" can be harmful as it assigns schizophrenia as that person's master status/principal defining characteristic and further serves to delegitimize us.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] People with schizophrenia are very diverse and there's nothing about us that is sinister or deceitful. Please don't casually throw us under the bus just to make a point.
identity_directed_counter_speech	This company is willing to pay to the lowest bidder for doing whatever job you want, not for paying a fair wage that supports their communities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why are you getting mad at immigrants? Illegal or otherwise?  Its the companies' conscious decision to hire at "subprime" wages. They are taking advantage of those who come from poorer backgrounds, at the expense of the communities those companies came from. [linebreak]  [linebreak] These companies that we beg to in hopes of receiving a wage, are the ones we should be mad at. They are the ones willing to circumvent our communitie's in order to raise profit margins for the top of the company.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why are people so willing to out the rights of companies and conglomerates over that of their own people?
identity_directed_counter_speech	I dunno. If you've ever jerked off to Piper Perri, some kind of "Stepmom" porn, schoolgirls, porn where someone is portraying a "teen" etc, you've basically taken part in ageplay, which according to threads like this, makes you a pedo and you should be extinguished from the Earth. Gonna be a pretty lonely Earth. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The rules all seem based on making sure people are consenting adults who aren't sharing even drawn pictures of anything, so it mostly seems fine to me because it's not based on anything real (tbh, I'm more disturbed by shit like A Serbian Film or any of Rob Zombie's splattergore movies existing because exploitation horror is disgusting and visually depicts that stuff, but others call if art and no one gets hurt, so eh)
identity_directed_counter_speech	Because someone trying to defend their unreasonably hated interests is just soooooo fucking funny. I'm only here for this post. Sorry kid, but I don't get off on laughing at other's expense so I'm going to gtfo of this degenerate cesspool asap. People wanna get rid of furries. Well how about places like this instead?
