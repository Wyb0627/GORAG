neutral	## Take 1: Autonomous vehicles will kill transit / will change transit so profoundly that we might as well stop building transit and wait for them to rescue us. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We build transit for many reasons, but the *chief* reason is to move as many people as possible using as few resources as possible: this, in turn, makes commuting cheaper, and frees up certain resources (like road space, parking spaces, fuel, etc.) to relieve pressure on commuters who make other choices. This also helps make our cities work better: more transit, less traffic, more commerce, fewer accidents, fewer person-hours spent sitting in traffic, easier for law enforcement and emergency vehicles, ancillary benefits (better for the environment, conserve manufacturing resources, get around the city without a car...), everybody's a winner. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And autonomous vehicles have absolutely nothing to do with that. Look at it like this: [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many subway trains does it take to move 1000 commuters? 1. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many light rail vehicles does it take to move 1000 commuters? 5. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many double-decker buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 13. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many standard buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 20. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? In the United States, about 650. (As of 2018, most rush-hour private vehicles carried about 1.54 occupants.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] And how many autonomous private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? About 650. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which is to say, in any city large enough to support higher-order transit, *when it comes to the key reason we build transit*, transit will always beat autonomous vehicles. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to other situations -- rural areas, small towns, places where there simply isn't enough demand even to sustain a basic bus service -- autonomous vehicles will be a major boon. But in the big cities, the fundamentals for transit will remain strong. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 2: Transit agencies in Asia can turn a profit, so European and North American agencies should be able to do so as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Insofar as transit agencies in Asia turn a profit, they normally do so on their property holdings: they own the land above their stations, which gets turned into skyscrapers, which means dollars in their pockets. But this also means that these transit agencies aren't turning a profit *as transit agencies*. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have a friend who plays the trombone. She makes $100,000 a year, which is a *lot* of money for a trombone player. Of course, she makes that money by working as a *lawyer*. Should we therefore go around to every trombone player and tell them off for not earning six figures? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 3: Free transit would solve a lot of problems. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is a great solution for smaller communities, especially in cases where the agency spends more money collecting fares than it receives in fares. (After all, fares don't just get deposited in the farebox: someone has to count them, someone has to print and issue tickets, someone has to draw up reports, someone has to do bank runs, the agency needs a secure room to hold the money and fare equipment, fareboxes themselves aren't free... if you spend $100,000 per year on collecting/counting/depositing/handling fares, but only make $50,000 in the farebox, you're a prime candidate for getting rid of them.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is also a fine solution if you want to address specific social needs or social problems. For example, a growing number of agencies offer free services on New Year's night, and many also offer free services to and from major public events where drinking is commonplace. You might also offer free services between seniors' homes and shopping centres, or between campuses of a hospital or university. Makes a lot of sense. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But studies consistently show that free transit does more harm than good in larger communities as a general service. Specifically, free transit: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Causes driver morale to plummet. [linebreak] 2. Causes vandalism to skyrocket, which significantly increases maintenance costs and can also cause vehicle shortages. (If you're pulling 8 buses out of service due to vandalism every day, but you're only able to return 4 to service on an average day, you've got a bad problem.) [linebreak] 3. Turns vehicles into homeless shelters on wheels. [linebreak] 4. Attracts hooligans. (They can basically do whatever they want on the bus, and even if someone eventually forces them off... they can hop right on the next one.) [linebreak] 5. As a result of points 2, 3 and 4, free transit discourages "choice" ridership, and can actually increase the number of cars on the road. (If they don't feel safe and comfortable taking transit, people who can afford to drive instead will start choosing to do so.) [linebreak] 6. Significantly increases law enforcement callouts, partly because it significantly increases assaults on drivers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bottom line, it tends to do more harm than good. Even just charging a small fare (50 cents or the like) does a significant amount to deter these behaviours. Covering the farebox just unleashes it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 4: My city has terrible transit. It's so much better in [x]. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You think transit's better in New York, London, Paris, Chicago, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, Berlin, Sydney, whatever? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it is: these cities do have more options and modes of transit than your average city. But go to that city's subreddit and I guarantee you'll see the same gripes and problems as your city: bus bunching, cancelled services, short-turns, confusing maps, disinterested drivers, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't confuse your three-day sojourn in, say, Portland (during which you never travelled in rush hour, only visited downtown destinations, and took the streetcar just because you *could*...) for the reality of what people who actually live in that city put up with every day. If you had to commute from the suburbs to downtown, making two connections and consistently missing your bus, you would feel differently: in fact, you'd feel similarly to how you probably feel about your hometown's transit agency. You have my condolences for the inconvenience, but you also aren't so special. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 5: Here's a cool technology: let's shoehorn it into our system without a rationale. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This goes for: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Aerial tramways [linebreak] 2. Monorails [linebreak] 3. People-movers [linebreak] 4. Personal Rapid Transit [linebreak] 6. [Chinese straddling buses](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/18/business/global/18bus1/18bus1-jumbo.jpg) [linebreak] 5. River ferries [linebreak] 6. etc. etc. etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Many of these technologies are *interesting*, but people tend to obsess over them to the exclusion of more sensible transportation modes. There are *specific situations* where these technologies may make sense (monorails are great for tourists, aerial tramways can move people across bodies of water or up mountainsides, river ferries are great in cities built up around the river, etc.), but simply building them for the sake of building them (someone decides "hey, aerial tramways are cool, we should build an aerial tramway!") means your city will dump billions of dollars into acquiring a white elephant. On the plus side, as the only user, you'll be able to take some sweet unobstructed photos! [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to building higher-order transit (like monorails, people-movers, etc.), I've got a simple truism for you. You need one of two things: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. A *lot* of cyclical demand, to such an extent that buses can't carry the load. [linebreak] 2. A *lot* of conter-cyclical demand: all-day traffic in all directions, steady demand all day long. Usually this means linking a city centre with an amenity like a large university, a major intermodal transit hub, another city centre, a major shopping centre or district, a major tourist attraction, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you don't meet either criteria... stick to boring, bunchy, uninspiring buses. Detroit hasn't really profited from investing millions of dollars in a people-mover. Sydney wound up tearing out their monorail after years of disappointing results. New Orleans built an aerial tramway which lasted less than a year in revenue service. Save your money.
slur	Here's my pasta on Sargon. Share it far and wide: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ##Carl Benjamin, AKA Sargon of Akkad [linebreak]  [linebreak] ###Racism [linebreak]  [linebreak] > In two videos — one of which has since been deleted by YouTube [Audio here](https://youtu.be/3crSpvsp_kI?t=87)— Benjamin repeatedly used the n-word. He said a YouTuber and the alt-right were "faggots" and "acting like n*ggers" in showing him disrespect because "white people are supposed to be polite. You act....exactly like you describe black people acting".  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And no, it's not okay to use the n-word as an insult just because you're talking to racists. That 'context' doesn't make this okay. He wasn't talking to them on 'their level.' He was being a racist. [linebreak]   [linebreak] ###Anti-Semitism [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "I'm sorry about the Holocaust, but I don't give a shit." [linebreak]  [linebreak] ###More Racism [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "But over halfway into the [two-hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74llFWdeKNM), Benjamin seemed to lose his patience for the discussion. He repeatedly resorted to calling Catlin the n-word for not being able to have a civilised conversation." [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ""Why would you begin our conversation like that?" Benjamin said, pausing the video. "It kind of makes me think you want the internet to open up with a big bunch of memes on your ass calling you a n*gger. It's not personal — no one really thinks you're a n*gger."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ###Paedophilia [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "In 2017, Benjamin interviewed a Singaporean blogger called Amos Yee for his podcast, The Thinkery Podcast, where the two discussed scrapping the age of consent for sex. During the interview, Yee argued it "should be fine" and "completely reasonable" for adults to have sex with 13- or 14-year-olds. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "It's controversial because people have a kind of mental block in their minds when they talk about this," Benjamin said. "Because in, I think probably this country, we're in America at the moment and in Britain the age of consent is 16. If you were to say something like, 'Well, I think it should be reduced to 14,' that sounds like a hugely controversial opinion, that sounds like you want adults to prey on children." [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "It's actually not as controversial as you think," Benjamin said. "For example, I think in the Netherlands the age of consent is something like 12 or 14. It's actually surprisingly young to Western, you know, English-speaking sensibilities. But across the European continent its a lot lower than you would think."

And then goes onto talk about "Eddie", the guy he was "dating" at the time. I'm not even going to go into where it goes from there as Sargon laughs hysterically and joins in, because frankly I don't want to type out explicit descriptions of adults having sex with 10-year-olds."[Source](https://youtu.be/MkpYHrC2kCI?t=1630) [linebreak]  [linebreak] "I can be quoted as saying you can **** young boys. It's not as controversial as you think. Depends on the child, doesn't it? The ancient Greeks considered it to be normal, it was mentoring."

threatening_language	I like to think that everyone shitty on the Left is just a troll account created and maintained by Barron Trump, attempting to use his mammoth brain to make centrists vote Daddy 2020.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] [I messaged the mods asking why it had been removed.](https://i.imgur.com/XRoKw5k.png?1) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Their answer was that it was a "shit post". To which I argued that the sub is based on that and provided 6 links off the current front page that were just as bad, if not worse shit posts.
