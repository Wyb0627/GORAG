person_directed_counter_speech	No MSM interviews Beto about his hand movements and he says "I am what I am" but as a citizen I'm not allowed to see those hand movements first hand.  I'm only allowed to be told about them from an intermediate source (MSM). [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why you gotta hate?  This has nothing to do with Trump.
