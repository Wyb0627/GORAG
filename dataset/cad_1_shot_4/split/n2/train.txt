glorification	Not a holocaust denier just read about it realized it didnt happen the way the said like when Auschwitz changed their sign from 4 million dead to 1.5 million. That kind of brings the 6 million into question. To deny there were no atrocities that occurred during WW2 to Jews would be stupid. There is overwhelming evidence of it. Was it blown way out of proportion? Yes. Is there evidence of it? Yes. If you believe 6 million Jews were killed then you have a differing opinion than Auschwitz.
person_directed_counter_speech	>Pewdiepie follows a rather large number of fascists on twitter,  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Cite. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >and has hosted Ben Shapiro and reviewed Jordan Peterson, both of which are gateways to the altright.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's funny how many NPCs use the same "gateway drug" rhetoric people used to use with weed, only with politics. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >On a side note, I don't know how anyone can see how much hatred he had in his voice and expression when he used the n word to denigrate someone, but I could never support someone like that.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm black, and I've blurted out that word in anger before.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also like how you're ignoring the context; he was playing PUBG and got mad at the opposition. I don't think the other player character was even black. Oh, and he apologized. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > In any case, he's no friend of the gays, since he is a friend to fascists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unsupported premise. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >And btw, t series is basically Bollywood vevo. That's what his sub war is with. Indian vevo. There's a reason people call those who say everywhere "subscribe to pewdiepie" children [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh no! *People*! It's not like anyone has ever made a single cogent criticism about increasing  corporate influence on Youtube! [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] >>I just hate that a corporation might be the most highly subscribed channel on YouTube [linebreak]  [linebreak] >If you for one second think it even matters, you gotta really think about YouTube as a platform. Also at this point, what makes peqfiepie any different than some large corporation. He has millions and deals and all that shit. He's not some innocent little indie blogger... [linebreak]  [linebreak] T-Series earned a hundred million in seven months from Youtube. They're Goliath, not David. Good job deliberately leaving their side out of the comparison.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Pewds is still significantly more independent than T-Series, and that's what Youtube was built on. It was supposed to be an alternative to mainstream media, not a replacement. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also like the thread where someone posts 'evidence' of Joran Peterson's links to the alt-right, it's criticized, and [all they can do is go "u triggered, you big baby?"](https://np.reddit.com/r/gay_irl/comments/b29k3x/gayirl/eis32iq/) and "ironically" use right wing memes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Not to mention the guy who said supporting free-speech is alt-right.
