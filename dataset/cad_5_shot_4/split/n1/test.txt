neutral	u/Elainepaige123 So I had started talking to this guy about five months ago, that liked me back in high school. Im now 20 and he's 21. It started out as texting and then we started hanging out. At first I had made it clear that I only wanted to be friends. I really liked him, but my Christian parents did not allow me to date him, because he is an atheist. I am completely undecided as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out, but at the time I was just going to school and was completely dependent on my parents financially and had to follow their rules. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My parents allowed me to hang out with him as long as nothing more happened, but then eventually things escalated to the point where we were making out, so I called it all off in order to make sure that nothing went further than I was comfortable with at the moment, as things were moving very quickly, but mostly because my mother found out and didn't allow me to contact him anymore. I sent him a message and explained everything about my parents and how I wasn't allowed to see him. He texted me two weeks later and says he just misses talking to me so we started talking again secretly over text messages. Before long I am sneaking out and going to see him again until eventually he told me that he loved me and that we should move in together as soon as he started his new job. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He said that he wanted to help me get out of my parents house, as they are extremely controlling and he hated them for it. He was in the process of getting a new job and said when he got his first paycheck we'd get an apartment together, as I was also starting a new job. He was telling me that he had never met anyone like me and that he didn't want to lose me. He also said that I was his best friend, which is when I fell hard, because I've never had a best friend. eventually I was sending nudes, as we rarely got to see each other and we were sexting and we were even making plans financially and he seemed super sincere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He got the job that he had been wanting and we were so happy. The next day I lost my virginity to him and two days later he texts me and says I'm too nice for him and that he doesn't love me anymore. He told me we should both be single and that he was distracting me from nursing school. He also told me that he was a bad guy and that i could do better. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I asked for a better explanation, but he said, " listen to me! You can just be a friend I'm at work now!" Later I told him that I had to block him and wouldn't be able to speak to him again and he said, "alrighty.". I asked him why he was being so cold and he said it wasn't cool of me to block him. I explained it was because of my parents and he said he was sorry and that he understood. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That's the last I heard from him. Did he ever love me or did I just get played? Is it possible that he faked a whole 5 month relationship? Could he have lied about everything he said about me? [linebreak]  [linebreak] or was he for real about his reasons? It was all so sudden and he hasn't spoken to me since, as my parents found out that I was sneaking out and forced me to block him and put a tracker app on my phone so that they know everywhere that I go. I'm so confused. I still love him and he said he wanted friends, but now I can't speak to home at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I want closure, but don't know how to get it. I was honestly turning into a nervous wreck, because of the situation with my parents. All of the lies and lack of freedoms was getting to me and I wasn't okay. He kept telling me I looked "devastated" the last time I saw him. I was not mentally well, because I felt like I was morally wrong. I used to send him long messages every so often explaining my emotions and then regret it later, but he said he was okay with it. I wonder if that is why he left. I feel so embarrassed for opening up to him, as I am usually a shy person. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR guy that I fell in love with says he loves me, then dumps me after taking my virginity. Haven't heard from him since.
neutral	Background: 21 years old, chubby, friendless, haven't kissed a girl or even held her hand yet. I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed. The same dumb questions arise: "Why would I want to be ripped at 22? Will I even be able to catch up with social skills? Will it even be worth it?". [linebreak]  [linebreak] Any advice is welcome.
neutral	I'm not sure if this is actually a thing or not but I'm going to break down each of memorable highs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] First time getting high: Grade 10, at lunch time. I couldnt walk, couldnt stand, barely could speak and sat in the woods for little over 4hours. I was generally afraid for my life and was listening to christian music thinking I was going to die. Finally some chick came over and helped me get home which I fellasleep and felt super exhausted when I woke up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Second big high: Smoked with a lot of friends and played Fortnite, generally felt pretty good. I could only focus on one thing however, but when I focused on it I felt like I could really understand it. We were listening to music and I felt my ears could feel the beat in them (Like the Trap Nation logo in their videos but in my ears). If I rubbed my arms I could feel that same feeling over and over again even though I stopped doing it. Felt like my heart was pumping very fast and I was biting down hard on my teeth. I came to the conclusion that what I'm feeling is from the high, almost like a lucid high (??) Like I was awareness what I was feeling was from a high and I could control my high because I control my brain. If I opened my mouth I could still feel the feeling of my clenching my jaw, if I stopped putting my hand over my heart I could still feel my heart pounding. I could stop and continue effects, almost like I was coding my brain to stop and start whatever I wanted to do. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Last big high and last time smoking (2 weeks ago): 16% thc prerolls I bought at the liquor store, couldnt even finish the whole joint, got half way before I threw it out. I had to find an activity I could do because if I kept to myself I felt like I would get lost in my mind and eventually die. It felt like I was connecting all the dots to life, I had to snap myself out of thinking too much because it made me want to fallasleep and at the time falling asleep = death. I had to keep my mind away of thinking about my high, if I thought about it my heart felt like it would speed up, like a wheel and it would get faster and faster and then eventually it felt like someone was whipping my consicous, I'd think about something and then I'd hear the crack of a whip and the thought would be gone. I felt like my sober self was fighting my high self to see who could keep conscious and it was exhausting. I had to keep throwing out thoughts because I'd spiral farther down and couldnt stop myself. I tried watching Brooklyn 99 but I kep imagining my life as a movie, and what would someones reaction would be to what I was doing right now, then I'd imagine my reaction to me thinking about my life as a movie and the cycle would continue. I tried taking a shower but it felt too good and relaxing, It felt like my legs were telling my brain that they were done standing and going to give out soon. Overall it was like each part of my body was its own body and they all were trying to communicate at the same time. Then I decided to play Fortnite and LoL, first couple of games were rough but then I decided that if I control my brain I'll force myself to get into the perfect state of mind to play, so I did. Just thinking about the right state of mind allowed me to get in it, and I played the best I've ever played in my life.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] What are my theories? I must be triggering some receptor or something in my brain that causes a episode. But I also think that while I'm high I control more of my brain because the thc receptors in my brain is filled up rather than being empty normally (if thats how it works). I generally believe that I can overdose on marijuana, and I want to get my brain checked out while I'm high, I'm fine with being the first person to OD on marijuana if it furthers the research.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So what do ya'll think? I'm up for any questions.
neutral	I've got some questions for you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] - **How old is your child?** [linebreak]  [linebreak] - **Is your child the #1 most important thing in the world to you?** [linebreak]  [linebreak] - **Do you still love this woman?** (I'd be surprised if you didn't). [linebreak]  [linebreak] These are the important things you need to answer to understand and make a proper decision on what to do from here on. Being cheated on is a dreadful thing to experience but since there's a child involved here, hasty moves or bad decisions will affect the child more than it will affect you or her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You don't have to give me the answers but at the very least, answer them for yourself and remember that your child is the most important thing to think about right now.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If your child is under 18, a divorce won't wreck the child's life but it'll turn their world upside down quite a bit. Likewise, if you stay together, I can see the resentment building up and cause marital issues at home and if the child is present while they take place, it'll affect them badly as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You have financial problems as well that could come out of a divorce. You'll have to pay child support (likely). Alimony is another problem you'll (probably) encounter. You'll have less say in your child's life if your child chooses to live with the mother. You won't get to see the child as much as much.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you still love her then this makes this whole thing ten times harder than it already is. You can't help it but it's really not going to help you either. She might cheat on you again, she may even be cheating on you right now with a new person and you wouldn't even know it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you still have concerns about her cheating on you again, what would be the best course of action is to "separate" but only in your relationship and not your marriage. This is so the child gets the best benefit out of this. You're both still married, you live in the same house, you both take care of the kid but you're no longer "together". [linebreak]  [linebreak] That way, if she decides to cheat on you again, it won't cause any issues. You'll also be free to seek other women as well for your own benefit as well. And once the child reaches the age of 18 (or until the child moves out), you can decide to divorce her and forget about her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But if you feel you can actually work it out properly and still have a proper relationship then you should try to do just that. It's down to your judgement ultimately. Just remember, there's absolutely no reason why she wouldn't cheat again. She managed to hide this one from you for four years and you couldn't do a thing about it. *She had to tell you* and it was only because she couldn't handle the guilt anymore and even then, it was because she felt sorry for herself and not you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have to tell you, I'd be paranoid all the time. Every single time she went out and came home late, "*is she fucking another guy again?*" Every time she's on the phone, "*is she texting another guy? What are they talking about?*" Every time she acts weird, down or strange, "*is she feeling guilty because she fucked another guy again?*" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or she doesn't want sex with you, "*did she already have sex with another guy? Has she been cheating again?*" This is but a taste of what it feels like being with a person that has admitted to cheating on you. It's mental torture of insecurity, paranoia and heartbreak and you'll hate every second of it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Jesus, it'd be pretty bad, so do it how you want to do it but make sure the child doesn't get punished for it. Look after your own mental health as well and don't brutalize or mentally torture your wife either. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you're feeling angry or sad, don't make any decisions until the feeling passes.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I wish you good luck, bud.
neutral	I used to be depressed. For about 10 years, after dropping out of college. About 5 months ago after spreading myself incredibly thin trying to solve everyone else's problems in my clan, I meet someone who seems to just click with me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] No name but a letter. Anime pic. Everything should have told me this is a catfish. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But I was so fucking lonely. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It comes to be this person happens to be extremely rich on Runescape, and offered to give me 20 bonds for gold premier. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The catch? I had to give them the 7 bonds I had already, because "It'll be a better gift if I give you all 20!" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Of course I do so without thinking. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Trade complete. [linebreak]  [linebreak] B has left the clan. B has logged off. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm just sitting there staring at those words on my screen. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This must be a prank, right? No one would do that, be nice to someone then backstab them as soon as they get something, right? [linebreak]  [linebreak] 10 minutes pass. I haven't moved. One of my friends PM's me "Why are you on that world?" [linebreak]  [linebreak] All I could manage to say was "I don't know." [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd just gotten scammed because I was thinking with my dick. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't show my face to my clan anymore. They'll never let me live it down. I can't handle that. I'm supposed to be the clan mediator who helps everyone resolve issues. Not the completely broken mask that it actually is. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I left. Never logged in again. On anything. Totally off the grid save my job. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A month goes by. My phone blares notifications at me... "Naive we miss you." "Naive, hope you're okay." "Naive what happened?" "Naive we're really worried." [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lies. All lies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] About a month and a half ago, I finally summon the energy to go to the doctor. I just tell her right out I'm depressed. She prescribes me 200mg Bupropion, twice daily. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So now I'm on medication for depression. Doesn't feel like anything. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Until 3 weeks ago. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of a sudden, I'm a completely different man. Garulous, entertaining, genuinely fun to talk to. Came back to my clan ecstatic. Things are looking good for once. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Except when you didn't agree with me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then I was the absolute hugest asshole in existence. Because how DARE someone try to harsh my happiness? [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I treat them like I would any other asshole. I mocked them. I poked fun at all the words they say. And when they inevitably fight back, I get underhanded. Start slinging shit that was told to me in confidence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Of course they respond in kind. And then I played the victim. Dissected their words and arguments, completely contradicting myself at times just to win the argument. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh I won the arguments. But now the entire clan hates me. They don't even acknowledge me when I speak in the clan. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've become *that* guy. The one you have to tip toe around on eggshells because he might snap and bite your head off. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've become the crazy one. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not fixed. Sure I'm no longer depressed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But I've never felt more isolated than I do in this very moment. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They just wrote me off. I can't blame them. No one wants to deal with someone whose perception of reality is this fucked. [linebreak]  [linebreak] No one wants to hear out why I'm saying the things I say. No one is acknowledging that I said I need another break from Discord. No one cares. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I left. Again. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I shouldn't be around people. I'm trash. Filth. The worst kind of asshole, the one that *has* to be right. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't end up like me. If you were depressed and now feel almost insanely good, see your doctor. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't be the reason your friends give up on you. You'll regret it so much, like I am now.
neutral	My best friend, who I grew up with and had a HUGE crush on, and I began talking again after almost 10 years. Back in the day it was the fantasy childhood sweet hearts. We were two peas in a pod and loved being around eachother. Well fast forward a few years we started being intimate. Our family eventually found out and she left me and I left home. Now 10 years later she reached out to me out of the blue and we started talking. Side note, 2018 as a whole was the worst year of my life. When I say the whole year, every month, every day was emotionally and physically taxing to a degree where my hair is literally thining and  falling out I mean it(my hair used to be thick and healthy).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So we start talking and it feels as though no time has passed at all. Its great! I cant believe she is talking to me again. But in my gut I know its just a rebound text(my mom told me she recent broke up with a 2yr relationship). Well she isnt doing to well either and she tries to kill herself so I call out of work for a whole week and I am across the whole country the next day to see her in the hospital. She is finally released and we have an amazing week together! Doing everything, always laughing and just enjoying eachothers company. But theres an issue, she constantly lied to me, about stupid stuff. She is a terrible liar but I never called her out. Even her mom told me she was sleeping with multiple people and when I asked she lied about her previous relationship even though she brought that up. There were so many red flags that I ignored, so many times she made herself to he victim to everything and I knew was trying to get me to feel sorry for her, and I ignored them all because I wanted to support her. On the last night we are snuggled up in her bed as we did everynight and she keeps pulling me on top of her to just "get closer" as she says (yeah okay). We start kissing and I ask over and over if its what she wants (i dont want to have sex but i wanted her to be happy and she seemed to really want to) and you can guess what happened. Well I drive home that night and cry all the way home because I know I was just used.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Over the next couple weeks she slowly talks to me less and less and barely wants to see me after I move back home after almost 10 years away. I finally call her and confront her and she tells me nothing has changed and hasnt talked to me since.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am so disgusted with myself for being so easy and ignoring all the signs that she was manipualting me. I cant even look at her because she isnt even the same person she used to be and it hurts so much. Not a single apology or an attempt to say anything from her. I dont know why she used me and I am so broken up about it. I told her all the shit that went down even about me losing my daughter that year (2018) and she still did this. Idk what to do. I want peace but she wont talk to me anymore.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] P.S. There were so many more flags and signs i ignored from family and friends but this post is long enough. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR:  My best friend/sweet heart from child hood called me up after 10 years. She was struggling so I went to help her out. My time with her was great but there were alot of red flags I ignored. I didnt want to sleep with her but she kept pushing so I did then she started to distance herself from me. I feel so used and disgusted with myself and I dont know why she did it.
neutral	And I can't believe that what set me off today was not being able to find part of a fucking IKEA cabinet. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not happy, I can't remember the last time I was, and I'm not sure I even know what I need to be happy with my life. I don't know what to do. I've been on antidepressants, and I still feel this way. Sometimes I have good days or good weeks, but I usually end up completely melting down and losing it again over something. I don't know how to make it better or if I even can. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't afford to move out. I can't afford to rent where I live, I certainly can't afford to buy a house or a flat, and I don't see a way out. Every time I'm reminded of the lifestyle my parents had at the same age as me, it upsets me because I know I'll never have that, it's going to pass me by. I don't even know why I want to emulate them in that way because they're divorced now. I'm scared that down the line I'm going to feel like I've missed a whole chapter of my own life. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My girlfriend broke up with me a year ago. She did the worst thing that anyone has ever done to me, I don't forgive her and I never will. I find it hard to meet people and I thought she was going to be it for me. I still miss her and I think I'm probably going to carry this for the rest of my life. She didn't just take away the relationship, she took away all the hopes and dreams I had for being a proper functioning adult and being happy. What's really bothering me about it right now is that I ruined things - before they even started - with another girl who liked me and who I liked too, to be with her. This absolutely is my fault and even if it probably wouldn't have worked out with her I spend far too much time thinking about if I blew my chance at being happy with someone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I hate my job. If you told me tomorrow that it was gone and I could never go back, I wouldn't care. Wouldn't give one single solitary fuck. I hate the building, I hate the place it's in, I hate the noise, I hate the customers, I hate all of it. I could just find a new job and leave, but I feel so completely ground down and I don't think I would find anything better so I can't motivate myself to. I could go back to university and learn to do something else but not without getting myself into a lot of debt I'll never be able to pay off. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've never wanted to have a real job, because I can't handle the real world. As a kid I dreamed of being an athlete, although it became clear pretty early on that I was never going to be. I love sports but I'm just not good enough to even play at a recreational level, and that kills me and I don't enjoy them as much as I would like because of that. Then I started to pursue music, and I was OK at that, but I just can't do it. I can't meet other people who share the same musical aspirations as me, I can't write a song because nothing comes out when I try to, I just can't get it right. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't stop obsessing over things that I can't change. I can't stop obsessing over perfection and trying to obtain it. I can't stop obsessing over how all kinds of small details in my life are wrong. I can't feel part of anything. I can't even build a set of fucking shelves. I can't have all the time back that I've wasted. I can't cope. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I feel like an entitled little prick for being bothered by these things as much as I am.
neutral	I knew this was going to pop up in here! [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is a dicey topic.  Over there someone pointed out that she should have gone to a more pet friendly place, but people are forgetting that prior to ESA laws opening up, it was *impossible* to find pet friendly places.  *Especially* for large animals.  I lived in an apartment complex in the 00's with a dog run that allowed large dogs, and worked there for a bit.  We were the *only* complex that allowed dogs in the area, through the major city we abutted.  And by the time I left, they had come up with the brilliant idea of instituting "pet rent," an increase of rent to cover pet fees on *top* of usurious non-refundable security fees.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] ESA certification allowed people to have a pet, a desperately needed pet who yes, have been proven to have deep psychological benefits to their people, without having to go through all of the difficulties.  Especially poor people, who are usually unable to find other methods of coping and need them the most. [linebreak]  [linebreak] On the other side, not everyone can handle ESA's.  I love dogs, I've had some amazing dogs.  But I was attacked as a child by a few dogs and it took a while for me to manage my fear and distrust.  I still have a deep and unreasonable hatred of cocker spaniels, can't help it.  My husband is allergic.  I am too, mildly though.  If the dog has been bathed in a week, I'm usually fine. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We were in a pizza restaurant eating and a couple came in with an [afghan dog](https://images.app.goo.gl/3FCkPSTc1Wooe39D6).  They allowed some children to play with and pet the dog, which was shedding noticeably as it was summer.  My husband started to have an allergic reaction.  The couple sat, he asked the pizza people to please have the dog put outside.  As he was doing this, some customers came in behind where my kid and I were sitting, saw the dog, made disgusted comments, and left. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Husband stormed back and left; they chose to keep the dog in the restaurant despite his visible allergic reaction.  My husband, the man I call Snow White incarnate, who held a battered dog on the side of the road we found until the police arrived to take her to the vet, just wanted to eat in peace and this was denied him.  So, we left.  The emotional presence of a dog for that couple was more important than the physical health of my husband. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've utilized the ESA privileges (for housing), as I do have qualifying conditions.  I've never taken my animals anywhere they wouldn't legally be allowed without it, however.  I still remember vividly what it felt like to have that dog turn and look at me and lunge.  I still see it every time I see a cocker spaniel.  I see my husband with certain dog breeds, even though he adored them, red eyed, runny nosed, choking.  I also remember how lucky I felt to find a place that allowed big dogs so I could get my girl, and the amazing life I had with her.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It seems to me we need to have much clearer rules.  We need to be able to have purely animal free places for people who legitimately need it *and* places that allow it.  The issue is that when you give a landlord the option, they will generally choose no animals since that is the cheapest option.  (Seriously, one couple force bred their Pitts to sell the litter - inbred idiots - and kept the pups indoors so we wouldn't know and then absconded in the night.  We had to go down to the sub floor it was so bad). If you force it to be open to all, then you have no place for the people who *can't* be around animals and are unable to afford to pay for a house.

neutral	For background, I (25M) have been with my current girlfriend (21F) for nearly 2 years, and we have been going pretty well in terms of everything major. We rarely argue, we share very similar mindsets and interests, but the smaller differences are starting to affect me. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can say that she could be my future wife if she dropped a few habits, but I honestly don't see her doing so. She smokes cigarettes and does a lot of recreational drugs; cannabis, mdma, psychedelics, and has recently been interested in dmt. She has mild depression, diagnosed anxiety, and doesn't have any hobbies. Because she doesn't have any hobbies, she is always smoking marijuana daily, and she is always looking for the next opportunity to do mdma(once every few months) and I feel like her life is revolving around recreational drugs, albeit this is not heavy usage, purely to pass time. She is obsessed with having children and more pets, but at times her depression leads to neglect her current pets. She is insistent on having children in the future, but I can easily see the drug habits and depression affecting the well-being of her child and any future pets she wants to adopt. She does not see her drug problem as an issue, and says that she has the will to quit of necessary, but I don't believe her because I have seen how low her depression can pull her down. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] As for some background on myself, I'm a quiet introvert with a lot of hobbies, stable job with a mortgage, I occupy my time with various things, like home improvement, computer games and watching netflix. I also have a lot of creative art hobbies that I do from time to time. My view on recreational drugs is quite lax, I am aware that they do have inherent health risks and toxicity but this isn't the sub to discuss that. What I am willing to say is that I also enjoy recreational drugs from time to time, but I'd prefer it to be less frequent, and for it to not be the main focus of an activity.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Since being with my girlfriend, my drug usage has increased, and often times we will resort to smoking weed just to pass time. There is also a heavy expectation on me to sort out activities and entertainment for any given weekday, and she will complain loudly if not occupied. This will often default back to smoking more cannabis, which I'm not the greatest fan of.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have suggested many times for her to adopt a hobby, but she dismisses this and continues to occupy her time with drugs, when I try to push the matter, she will need to smoke cigarettes to alleviate her stress. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I honestly love my girlfriend, and I can see us staying together indefinitely if we stay on a similar path, but her insistence of a child conflicts with her cigarette and drug use. I would have no issues with her lifestyle if she didn't want a child; but as she is so clucky and unwilling to care for herself,  I feel that any child brought into this world will be in danger. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I really don't know how to approach the matter, and I have been thinking about this for the longest time. I can't see her using less drugs, changing her mind about having a child, or picking up hobbies to occupy her time, and this is a major hurdle in our relationship. I can see us being best friends, and her having a child with another person, but I would still worry about the welfare of the kid, and breaking up and remaining mutual friends is always an idealistic situation that rarely works out. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I just wanted this off my chest, I didn't come here for advice, but suggestions or comments about my/her lifestyle will be read. Thanks for reading.
neutral	**Cyclists need to be aware on the road** [linebreak]  [linebreak] I learned to ride a motorcycle. This is something that is not really mentioned but is wholly related. Obviously, cars are a huge risk to those who ride a motorcycle for the same reasons cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What you're taught as a motorbike rider, the most important lesson, is that you're responsible for you. You cannot rely on a driver to be looking out for you. Not because they don't want to but because, like cyclists, you're less visible. Cars have blind spots and you can't expect them to always see you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The second most valuable lesson is that motorcyclists tend to make better drivers because they're more aware on the road and responsible for their driving decisions. They're more concerned about reacting to other drivers decisions rather than driving on autopilot and going, "oopsie" when something unexpected happens.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Being aware of your surroundings as a cyclist or motorcyclist is still essential to safety. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] **Cyclists need to be aware on footpaths (sidewalks)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] A car is predictable. In most cases, a car will be on the road. Unless it's pulling out of a driveway it's very rare to see a car that isn't on the road and it's impossible to see a road and not know that a motor-vehicle will use that road. Driving has rules. You stick to the designated areas and should there be any reason to be where a pedestrian might walk you look and wait for any to pass.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The same isn't said for footpaths (or sidewalks I think it's called where you are), bike tracks and cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is the case in many places here that both footpaths and bike tracks are shared by pedestrians and cyclists. It doesn't make sense to me either but basically, there are footpaths that just end in bike tracks and force pedestrians to use the bike track to get from point A to B. This usually isn't a big problem and pedestrians on a bike track are automatically more aware of the possibility of a cyclist. (If ever a reason to have ***more*** bike tracks exists, this is not a bad one at all) [linebreak]  [linebreak] The problem is the unpredictability of cyclists and a lack of presence.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A cyclist, here at least, is in no way predictable. A pedestrian will use a footpath, a car will use a road and a cyclist will use whatever is convenient at the time. With a lack of presence, it's impossible to know if you'll even see a cyclist on that day. Together you end up with both drivers and pedestrians not being able to anticipate if or when a cyclist is going to be there or how they're going to behave. This means a cyclist has to be more aware of their surroundings than the pedestrian as the pedestrian has no way of knowing how to react even when aware of the cyclist due to the unpredictability of the situation. In my experience with cyclists, there is no definitive answer to "how do I avoid a pedestrian". Some move to one side of the footpath, some ride on the road, some ring their bell so you can move out of their way and some creepily follow behind at a slow pace without ringing their bell until you notice and step out of their way like they expect you to be psychic or something. That last category is the jerks.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unlike with cars, there isn't some set rule that applies to all cyclists and pedestrians and unlike bike tracks, you can't stay aware of things you're unlikely to encounter. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The solution to this is actually having more bike tracks and cyclists rather than less. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I overthought the ***fuck*** out of this and strayed way beyond the original point of the thread.
neutral	A lot of the horribleness going on right now, both internally in the individual and on the external micro and macro levels, fit the prohecies about the Kali Yuga very well: [https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-predictions-of-Kali-Yuga](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-predictions-of-Kali-Yuga) [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't remember the textual basis for the specific explanations about the history of the gradual decline of the human form found in Buddhism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I obviously don't KNOW from direct personal experience or empiricism that the following is correct, but now I feel like digging more. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The teachings I received on that topic states (IIRC) that we've gone through what we might call a gradual grossification. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the distant past humans didn't possess solid bodies, but were "light beings," living thousands of years. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At a later stage in the process of degradation, humans were giants, still with a life-span many times that which we're used to now. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's kinda interesting in that context, that we've been finding skeletons of giants here and there. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We've slowly declined since then. We become more easily diseased, we increasingly ignore the suffering of our fellow beings, we have a very hard time questioning our persistent illusion (as Einstein called it) of dualism and physicalism (which I think lay at the basis of our ethical decline), and it's getting worse. [linebreak]  [linebreak] According to the Buddhist master I heard talk about it, the pollution of our environment is one mechanism by which the degradation will continue to worsen, until we reach the point where we're literal gnomes living no more than 10 years. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Our ethical and spiritual virtues, our true nature of boundless wisdom and kindness, will be increasingly inaccessible to us, velied behind thickening layers of delusion and ignorance. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is said that when the Dharma (a complex word, but in this case it refers to the teachings that lead to liberation) is completely gone from the world and forgotten by men, we will have reached the end of the Kali Yuga, after which the fourth Buddha, Maitreya (who is, curiously, unlike most Buddhas, always portrayed sitting on a chair) will appear. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Interestingly, Maitraya will teach only the basic vehicle of liberation, known as the Theravada/Hinayana ("way of the elders" or something like that, and "small vehicle" respectively), whereas the current Buddha, Shakyamuni, who appeared 2500 years ago, also taught the Mahayana (great vehicle), the Vajrayana (diamond or thunderbolt vehicle), Mantrayana, Mahamudra and Dzogchen. \[Edit: The latter four classes of teachings mentioned were in most cases not given through what could be called conventional means and not necessarily during the life time of the Buddha. Adherents of the Theravada/Hinayana schools will tell you that only the Pali Canon truly came from Buddha. Conversely, the higher schools will always include the teachings of the Theravada/Hinayana, which are a prequisite, beginning  with the Four Noble Truths and The Noble Eightfold Path.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] The reason for that, is that the Buddha knew about the Kali Yuga: how full of disturbing emotions we'd become, and how much suffering we would experience. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Mahayana is the path of the Bodhisattva, and along with the Hinayana it's prequisite for the practice of the higher vehicles, such as  Vajrayana, which is the vehicle of transformation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Knowing we would have a lot of disturbing emotions and suffering, providing the teachings that allow for the transformation of that into fuel on the path to liberation, was important. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's so much to say about this and so many interesting little nuggest to be found in the wisdom traditions of the east. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Again, I don't know any of this to be true, and my basis for the above is almost completely an appeal to authority. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm going to delve more into the topic. I'll probably post the write-up on r/psychonaut rather than here though :) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: Spelling + a few details.
neutral	[linebreak]  [linebreak] > I have so many questions... [linebreak]  [linebreak] > This Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted by telephone August 16-20, 2017 among a random national sample of 1,014 adults, including users of both conventional and cellular phones. The results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Sampling, data collection and tabulation by SSRS of Glen Mills, Pa. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is what I had read initially and had thought all 1014 answered each question, I hadn't seen the specific vote counts. That's my mistake, though I don't think an n of that size necessarily renders a poll worthless, and I still stand by my view that "nobody supports them except those in the group" is an exaggeration, and a potentially dangerous one at that.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also want to point out that the concern isn't so much the people that some people may currently support neonazism or white supremacy, it's those who aren't necessarily in that world but are susceptible to brainwashing and propaganda. Before probably the late 90s/early 2000s you had to join a group to be radicalized. Not the case anymore. It's the same MO that ISIS uses — find young men who are somehow emotionally susceptible to propaganda; maybe they hold a lot of anger in, maybe they are (understandably) sad and resentful that they can't find someone to date, maybe they have some unresolved trauma... and they find an ideology that for some reason is an outlet for that — it gives you something to express your anger and emotions at (even if it may not be wholly logical but someone can convince you it is). You don't have to meet up with people to be a white supremacist. You don't have to indicate it to anyone outwardly. As long as you don't express it in public, and you contain it to your online persona, nobody really ever has to know. But that doesn't mean you're not a white supremacist. It's still infected your mind and poisoned your thoughts. And you do, quietly, support those whose actions support the lies you've been deceived by. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ^just to be clear, this is in a generic "you", I'm not accusing you of any of this [linebreak]  [linebreak] > hit in the head with a baton or bat [linebreak]  [linebreak] I hope it's clear that I don't condone this whatsoever. And this isn't okay regardless of the victims political affiliation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > majority of people agree it's bad, which is not the case with the things antifa does. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But in order for this to be at all relevant — you would have to believe that antifa is exactly as bad as all the white supremacists and neonazis that I linked. Again, can you point to any political assassinations or murders by antifa? Or any things that are directly parallel to *any* of the stories I linked? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm also *very* doubtful that most people don't disagree with antifa in general, let alone specifically the violent actions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The difference between supporting assholes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Do you think all assholes are created equal or something? Would a guy who gets road rage and brake checks you be as much of an asshole as a guy who leaves his 2 year old child in the car while he gets smashed at the club, crashes head on and kills 5 people including his child? [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] People don't have to think about these things in a completely black and white way. You can agree with a particular groups intentions and motivations without condoning all of their actions. Just because two groups do bad things does not by nature of that make them equally immoral. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The hoax stuff is interesting and probably worth exploring but not sure how it relates to this stuff.
neutral	There is nothing remotely racist about this post.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Blacks do go into the woods to enjoy the outdoors through activities like hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, etc... But, blacks only make up about 13% of the population of America. Also, not many blacks actually go into the woods; only a very small percentage of them are active in the wild outdoors. Therefore, I suspect that of all of the humans that regularly go into the woods in North America, probably less than 1% of them are black.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why bring this up? My point here is that Bigfoot is not used to seeing black folks. This may provoke certain responses by a Sasquatch when it sees a black person, such as: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Confusion; [linebreak] 2. Fear;  [linebreak] 3. Trepidation; and [linebreak] 4. Curiosity [linebreak]  [linebreak] I believe that all of these are responses that can work to our advantage.  All of these potential responses will cause a Bigfoot some amount of pause, and this slight pause may be the difference between getting off a kill shot and not.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The fact is, sasquatch does not regularly see black people. Chances are better than not that when a Squatch sees a black person that it will be the first time it has ever seen one. It may get scared and freak out, or it may stand there and stare. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As a practical matter I think that a technique worth trying is to take a black person on some hunts. See how the Squatch population reacts to the black person and take note. I am aware of no other groups that have tried this, so I will be very interested to see the results.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are all sorts of variations on this concept. The goal here is to throw a Bigfoot off balance with some sort of odd occurrence in the woods. The idea is to create a weird scene in an area where Bigfoot are present and which is not threatening to the creature. At the same time, you want it to perplex the BF to the point where it is standing there just scratching its head at the spectacle. While this is going on we will have snipers strategically placed whose job is to locate the Sasquatch and to put a bullet in the animal's head.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Here are some other ideas I have to cause a Bigfoot to pause due to confusion:  [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Outdoors sex/orgy: Get some skanky swingers group together and get them into the woods to screw and orgy in a Bigfoot hotspot. This will really pique a scratch's interest. At some point a Squatch will stick out its head to see what the fuck all that sucking and slapping noise is, then one of our snipers blows his brain out!  [linebreak]  [linebreak] 2. Poker game in the woods: same concept as the orgy but less gross. It probably will take longer to attract a Squatch.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] 3. Strange looking people: these are people that Squatch are not used to seeing. For example, dress up like a party clown and walk around in a hotspot zone juggling bowling pins.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] 4. Fighting: put together a group of low-life fight-club types, take them into the woods and let them fight. The noise and weird scene will generate some Bigfoot interest.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some believe that Sasquatch are something like forest ninjas: fast and stealthy. I think that if you do something truly weird then we may be able to confuse and agitate the animal. Confusion and agitation does not comport with stealth and concealment. Therefore, we take the Squatch's advantage away from it. This will make it t more likely to show itself and, thereby, give us a shot at it.
neutral	She didn't work.  She stayed home with our 2 kids.  She got the house she wanted.   She got the cars she wanted.  I did all of the housework.  I did all of the yard work.  I learned to cut down tall trees and turn them into small logs for her.  I learned to repair cars for her.  I took her wherever she wanted go.  Plays, vacations, concerts, art shows, festivals.  Some days I would actually sit on the riding mower and think about how lucky I was. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then my wife suffered an aneurysm.  I spent 10 days shuttling between the hospital with my wife and the home with our kids.  Whatever she wanted I brought to her.  Whatever the kids needed, they got.  The balls stayed in the air. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the months following her release,  I took care of her like a nanny.  Whatever she wanted she got.  She wanted a new car.  We got her the top of the line package.  She wanted a new TV.  She wanted a new laptop.  She wanted new clothes and a new kitchen.  Done and done and done and done and done. [linebreak]  [linebreak] She entered peri-menopause.  Everything that she could not control became Enemy.  She became paranoid.  She obsessed over the minutes between my end of work and when I got home.  She obsessed over my daily mileage.  An extra tenth of a mile or an extra minute meant that I was fucking the neighbor.  She claimed that I tricked her into buying the new car and the new kitchen when she was weak.  We did not have sex for the final three years of cohabitation.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The kids began to suffer.  She became increasingly volatile and violent.  Many times I came home to a broken interior door or a hole in a wall.  If I was home I had to be ready to get between my wife and my children at the drop of a hat.  He rmother pleaded with her to get professional help.  Our pastor pleaded with her to seek professional help.  I agreed to see a therapist with her and, after our third session, the therapist told her that she should seek help from a PhD level neuropsychologist.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Eventually the kids moved out of the house.  She demanded that I remove them from my will.  She demanded that I stop supporting them in any way.  I was to stop their annual gifts.  i was to stop paying for their health insurance.  She threatened to call my HR department, pretending to be me, and remove them from my benefits.  She stole tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts and was charged with multiple felonies.  My children asked the prosecutor to go lightly on their mother and the charges were dropped after she returned their money. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Eventually she filed for a TRO because she claimed that I was stalking her.  I moved out and filed for divorce. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have offered to give her everything.  The house that is nearly paid off and easily sold or refinanced.  The cars that are paid off.  Every single piece of movable property.  All I want in return is my retirement.  I just want to be shut of her.  She refuses to respond to my offer. [linebreak]  [linebreak] She has filed for disablilty benefits so that she can receive spousal support.  She has filed for multiple TROs, all denied.  Denied but costly to the defendant.  If one stuck I would probably lose my job.  [linebreak]  She is hell-bent on bankrupting me even though it bankrupts her, too. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Her death would make everyone sad but our lives would improve immensely.

For scientific research only, the ARWU (Shanghai Ranking) is comparable to the Times Higher Education Ranking.

Look at how many famous successful journalists work for them. The Wall Street Journal is also one of the world's largest circulated weekly news source and features a variety of top-notch content. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] US News, beside their "ranking," is a garbage little newspaper company, and only sounds prestigious due to their name. Nearly no famous/influential people work for them. They have a terrible track record and are truly a laughingstock if you investigate the state of the company.

neutral	Let me find out one of my parents says that to me. I'd be soo damn infuriated that it would propel me out of suicide and give me a reason to live again. Your dad is a sorry excuse for a man saying that to his suicidal child. Disgusting. I can set a standard that makes him an irrelevant worm in comparison too. But that isn't fair, is it?   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If I were you: "Oh alright. Well then, with that, our "relationship" has actually just ended. I will no longer speak to you again nor ask you for help. Since you seem nonchalant about my existence in this world, goodbye. Don't speak unless it is in an apologetic manner for the absolute filth you just hurled at me. As for the financial matter, thank you for stating the terms of business. I'll work out a way to sustain myself, since you both have made yourselves abundantly clear. I do not and will not expect monetary aid from you. Thank you."   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm in a similar place as you. Both of my parents are acting insane, though one of them actually is a sociopath. And yes I've had suicidal thoughts on and off almost my whole life. My sociopath parent has plenty of money, houses, etc. We've never had a relationship except when I was a baby(doesn't count). I've literally told this parent to not put me in their will. It was to send a message. What's that message?   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Money isn't love, and I don't need that from you. I never needed it. I needed a parent, but now it's too late and I'm indifferent(or more accurately don't WANT a relationship). Just like you've been my entire life. If you don't have an innate desire out of your own heart to help your own child, then I absolutely do NOT want anything at all from you. I don't accept blood money. Period.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Leave your parents house ASAP. I'm telling you. I waited too long, don't be like me. Do it NOW. You won't heal/grow properly unless you do. They're probably the ones making you suicidal. Leave and rely on yourself if you have to. That's what I'm doing right now and it feels awesome. If you have to wait and save up money for college I say it's worth it. The satisfaction of not taking a dime from your parent that doesn't care if you exist is priceless. Be independent ASAP. You have innate worth and dignity just by virtue of being a human being. You need to respect yourself too, and know that you have worth. Just because they are your parents, that does not give them impunity to hurl crap at you without consequences. Stand up for yourself, respectfully. Be confident you're in the right and don't let anger consume you. You have value, and are valued, and nobody can take that away. Work however much it takes to get out. Once you're independent and floating your own boat, reexamine your suicidal thoughts if they're there still. I know it sounds kinda dumb but literally tell your suicide to take a back seat and do this task first. I can guarantee you will AT LEAST feel better, and maybe not suicidal anymore. Process of elimination, eliminate the two glaring suspects. Don't keep debating within yourself like "Oh maybe I can stay longer and they will treat me better" etc. In your heart of hearts you know whether or not your living environment is toxic to your mental health. Sorry for ranting.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] God bless.

neutral	[linebreak]  [linebreak] Using a throwaway account now. I had been depressed lately ever since I started my winter quarter of college as a first year. I am now currently a sophomore year going into junior year. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I grew up with engineering drilled into my brain. My dad is an engineer, and as a little kid I always solve problems, create new objects with lego pieces, and always wondered how cars work. I excelled in many math and science tests until starting middle school when I moved into a bit more average. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I then entered a top tier engineering school under an engineering program. I quickly realized how much I hated chemistry and barely scrapped by with a D in both Calculus 3 (Taylor series, sequences, etc...) and chemistry II, got into academic probation. I then switched into another form of engineering, bumped my GPA up with easy classes just to get out of academic probation, then got into academic probation again after failing Statics with a F. I honestly feel very annoyed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm now sitting in my house during spring break thinking Engineering isn't right for me. I literally have no drive to do well in classes anymore. I hate going back to school, rather irritated each time I have to go back. I hate the constant going to class, sitting in there listening to pointless bullshit, then getting out. I hate the constant homework that is being thrown at me. The thing I hate most? Tests. Why do we have to memorize all of pointless math and others? I don't know which other major I can be interested at. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Most people I'm around with are rather shitty, or I just don't fit in with them. I am losing multiple friends back in home, and I'm not making any true friends in college. I'm always open to hanging out, but it's always like this: "I'm busy, sorry." Or some version of that. Or they just don't respond at all. I always have nothing to do rather than playing video games instead of seeing all other people going to college parties with their super close group of friends. I also got made fun of for driving a manual transmission vehicle that I bought, because it was cheap and reliable, but at least I have a freaking car to use, right? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why do I have to be that kid who peaked in high school? Back then when I had a girlfriend, was a sports team captain, always have fun stuff to do. Now I'm just sitting here with a low GPA and have not exercised in so long because of engineering work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm fucking irritated. I've been noticing I got angry a lot easier, especially after getting back test scores when all I want to do is to yell "FUCK ENGINEERING" in my brain. Why can't I just get my shit together? I hate being one of the least smartest students in class, but I loathe almost every single math and science courses I take. I loathe calculus and linear analysis. I loathe all physics, chemistry, and biology. Why did I let GPA dictate my happiness? And otherwise, why the hell do most jobs have this 3.0 GPA minimum required? It's a very stupid requirement to have, just seeing all those people who cheated their way being eligible for that job. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Feel free to ask me any more questions.
neutral	> According to the FBI, "A hate crime is a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias." The underlying problem with this definition is it elevates non-criminal activity to the level of a crime. Spray painting a phallus on the side of a building is vandalism. Spray painting a swastika on the side of a building is a hate crime.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > The first major problem we run into, then, is that the vast majority of recorded hate crimes fall into a number of activities that normally fall under misdemeanor or even civil categories. These actions include vandalism, simple assault and a vague category the FBI uses called "Crimes Against Society." Vandalism alone makes up a third of all events. It is troubling that the State elevates non-criminal matters into a criminal one based nothing on perpetrator motivation. The aforementioned swastika spray paint is no more difficult to clean off than a person scrawling their name.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > Digging further, the increase in reported hate crimes is driven primarily by these non-criminal acts.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > The disparity between real crime where people are harmed or property is irreparably lost and simple misdemeanor activity is staggering.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > An indicator hate crime isn't a problem is the rise of the hate crime hoax. According to researcher Wilfred Reilly, a Kentucky State professor of political science, there has been a [notable rise in hate crime hoaxes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hate-crime-hoaxes-are-more-common-than-you-think-11561503352).    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > In today's United States, there is immense value in becoming a victim of a hate crime. There is an outpouring of social support, TV circuit interviews and other social benefits. Being seen as authentic is so strong that people become [distraught when they find out they're not the ethnicity they think they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhW-wpQPkX4); these individuals are motivated to become a victim of such an event to solidify their social standing.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > Through the fact that there are *any* hoax events indicates that the problem of hate is, by and large, solved.     [linebreak] >   [linebreak] >  [The overwhelming support such people obtain as the immediate snap decision ](https://mises.org/wire/how-oberlin-college-faculty-tried-destroy-small-business-imaginary-crimes)has indicated that our society doesn't tolerate such behavior and, since society doesn't tolerate the behavior, finding individuals is equally rare. One doesn't need to raise awareness when the events are so few that cable news outlets can justify days of debate over each event; we're already pretty much aware the moment they happen. But one does need to raise awareness if they wish to have their 15 minutes of fame.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > [As I previously noted](https://mises.org/wire/combat-hate-make-government-weaker), the number of people who buy into hate ideology, regardless of motivation, is so trivial that they couldn't even fill a minor league baseball stadium. There are more people than this who think the Earth is flat, yet no one considers that a growing trend. It would be impossible to casually talk about Nazis being evil if they had any semblance of power or authority as people would tread more carefully. Being anti-Nazi is a safe and easy way to win social points since there is almost zero risk of reprisal. Just ask Wilfred Reilly, who is on actual enemies lists, just how dangerous they are (they aren't). However, politicians, certain groups and many individuals have strong incentives to manufacture hate crimes where none exist as such events generate votes, revenue and social attention.

neutral	Either accept the reality or change it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] **I propose that once upon a time Reddits subreddits were about discussing a subject.** [linebreak]  [linebreak] So /r/Food would be about discussing food. /r/News about discussing News. [linebreak] The same way even the political and other more divisive subreddits were about the subject itself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Even if /r/Socialism was run by a socialist and /r/Capitalism by a capitalist the purpose was not to create a community of socialists or capitalists but discuss the subjects, events and happenings concerning them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Today almost no sub is about about discussing it **but being part of it, being supportive of it, being loyal to it.** [linebreak] (Exceptions for like "True, or Truetrue subs). [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is why TD bans even supporters of **Donald Trump** when critically analyzing the presidents actions in say his ever more hawkish appointments.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or why various socialist subs ban outright **socialist members** for lifting the issue in Venezuela from a critical point of view. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or even why the mods in /r/Food will ban you for criticizing someones food, or notion of food or beauty or taste of food.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The concept of what a sub is about has changed. Or rather what a sub is *for*. Subreddits are no longer divisions of topics but divided communities.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I remember on one of my older accounts one of my first banishments was in a subreddit for something literally called "/r/soylent" (from the movie Soylent Green) and rebranded as something positive. I was absolutely downvoted and then banished after a prolonged discussion (with little give and take) and I've seen this mannerism now spread to all sectors of Reddit.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We either need to change this very fundamental of perception in ourselves or we must accept that even completely benign and neutral subreddits like say /r/News or your local subreddit will be taken over by a particular group and that group will congregate around their definition of the subject and then proceed to isolate voices that do not adhere to that as it progresses to define itself, whether openly or subconsciously.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We must rethink what we use reddit for or concede that this is the future. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] ____ [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A way to stop this would be to change a fundamental concept of Reddit. To forbid subreddits from having selective enforcing based on any stance on any one issue.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So you could talk as much shit about socialism as you wanted in a socialist sub as you could talk shit about capitalism in a capitalist sub as long as you followed the rest of the subs rules.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I honestly think that it's either this or we might as well shut up about it, because organic change might not come about as all the subs are now protecting themselves against brigading and "concern trolling" and other such things the same way an arms race in real life functions. So either make them all bend the knee or the struggle is pointless. But at least we can come to a common understanding of why it is happening, hence this thread. This way we can also stop acting out as victims of a particular ideology, religion, sex, location, interest or what ever when we get banned.  We are victims of one side of Reddit, nothing else, sadly.

neutral	No one wants to date the "sick girl." [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I know what you're thinking: [linebreak]  [linebreak] No! That's not true!  [linebreak] There is someone for everyone.  [linebreak] It's not like you're contiguous. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just shut up and listen. It's not that simple. It's never that simple.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dating the sick girl means committing to non-commitment. Plans will be ruined, or more likely cancelled. Travel is rare or just completely out of the question. Dating the sick girl means put a ton of blood, sweat and tears into someone who might not even have a future. It means a lot of days sitting alone on the couch while she naps in the bedroom. It means being taken care of, even though it feels silly, because she understands how fragile the human body can be and she doesn't want to lose you. Because you mean everything to her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And she's not a passing fancy, or a charity case. She doesn't want your pity. She is not interested in a fleeting romance. So much of her life is fleeting, over before it starts. She's only interested in a solid lasting connection, it's something that is so very precious to her because the concrete often feels so out of reach for someone who lives with what she does.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's hard. It's not easy. It's not always fun.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I know what you're thinking: [linebreak]  [linebreak] No relationship is perfect. [linebreak] All relationships have problems. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Shut the fuck up because those problems are pretty fucking small in comparison to what comes with dating a sick girl. You don't get it unless you've lived through it. But even then you don't fucking get it because you're not her. You don't feel what she feels. You don't see all of her pain because she hides it from you, because she cares about you and wants to protect YOU. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And you can't protect her, and it's devastating. You can't protect her, and it makes you feel weak and useless. It starts to eat at you deep down, and it festers there until you can't take it anymore and then you do what seemed unimaginable. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You leave her.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And her heart breaks as it has every time before. She feels abandoned, alone and lost. She lost her rock. And it kills her inside, because she gets why you left, but she is also so angry because you don't fucking get it.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All she needed was for you to be her rock. [linebreak] Solid. [linebreak] Concrete. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And now she's left again with no one to lean on. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Because no one wants to date the sick girl. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: I'm honestly not interested in any unsolicited "advice".  The information provided is not even substantial enough for any unsolicited advice to even be remotely useful anyway. So if you're feeling the impulse do yourself a favor and keep it to yourself and not make yourself look like an asshole. You're welcome. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This was a rant. An expression of frustration and not meant to be any kind of discussion or condemnation of anyone.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Honestly it's kind of ridiculous that I have to explain that.
neutral	So which rule did he violate internet people: [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you see a post that breaks one or more of these rules, please report it so the moderators can take action. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 0: Be Civil [linebreak] Let's keep the talk and discussion on what ever the subject matter of the post may be. Resorting to personal quarrels and arguments that may use insults and other tribal-like behaviors will be deleted. Keep it civil. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 1: Correct Formatting [linebreak] The requirements for posting to this subreddit is to have a self contained opinion within the title. The text will be used to expand and elaborate on why you think/feel this way. You may also include why you think this is an unpopular or controversial opinion. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 2: Opinion must be unpopular/controversial [linebreak] This sub isn't just opinions, but unpopular and/or controversial ones. If your opinion has been posted to the subreddit recently, chances are it'll get removed. SO PLEASE SEARCH BEFORE SUBMITTING. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 3: No Reposts/Search Before Submitting [linebreak] If essentially the same opinion gets reposted it'll automatically mean it's not an unpopular opinion (within the context of the sub). It WILL get removed. If your opinion is about a ongoing event, there will usually be a mega thread where you can discuss there. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 4: No Spam [linebreak] New accounts are subject to a 24 hour waiting period before posting. Spamming will usually result to a perma ban. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 5: No Trolling [linebreak] Trolling is saying random unsolicited things that only serve to invoke a knee jerk reaction. Trolls will usually get permanently banned. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 6: Elaborate [linebreak] An important rule in this subreddit is that all opinions must be elaborated on. There is a discussion to be had, so please expand on what you have said. [linebreak] Your post must contain more than 160 characters (roughly two or three standard sentences) to avoid auto-deletion by automod. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 7: Hate posts are not allowed [linebreak] Opinion can be unpopular unless it's blatantly a hateful post. Hostile, rude and aggressive behavior is not a necessity to express your opinion. Please be civil and and have respect. Bear in mind that justifying or endorsing pedophilia activities (sidenote: discussion on treatments of the mental health itself is fine), rape, race issues, assault or other similar crimes will usually count as hate speech. This does not mean you'll get banned for saying one crime is not as severe as another or saying you can understand why someone would commit a crime. Race baiting is a ban-able offence [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 8: No Low Effort/Satire Posts [linebreak] Any opinion that is not thought out well or posts that clearly have very little effort put into them will be removed. This also includes commonly posted opinions to the subreddit. Please note that obscure topics and meta commentaries on the subreddit do not constitute a valid unpopular opinion post."
neutral	A real suicidal person wouldn't tell anyone. They'd just do it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yeah but I'm a wimp and probably wouldn't follow through but I'm still having these unending thoughts every day and it's hard and I want your support. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I made the mistake of telling them this when they were yelling at me about wasting my time and being lazy and getting bad grades and I'm not shitting you my dad told me "well if you're gonna be lazy and just waste space in the world you might as well do it." I'm not even doing that poorly. I have all A's and a B. And the B is in fucking physics for pre med college students, it's hard.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And they actually asked me *why* I'm suicidal. I just fucking am I can't help it it's been like this for 5 years but it's been a lot worse recently. Then my dad fucking turns to my mom and asks her why she was suicidal in high school and she says "because my parents didn't love me or care about me and put me in dangerous situations, and I didn't tell anyone I just attempted but failed," and then turns back to me and says "what's your excuse? do you really think we don't love you or something?" Like I'm sorry I'm losing the My Life is Hard competition but I can't just stop feeling like this. And then he finishes up with "you won't actually do it. you're too selfish." Honestly fuck my life at this point.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I started crying and told them I just want some support right now and my dad said "you really think we don't give you fucking support" and went on some tangent about how hard his life is because of me and how much he does to support me like no I'm talking about right now this topic I just want you to tell me it's gonna be okay. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of this was after a like glorious  2 month period of my parents being really nice to me then they hit me with all this shit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm so hurt and starting to think I can't be around them anymore. They're behavior just changes so fucking drastically like this and I don't think I can live with them any longer. I was planning on living at home my freshman year of college (next year) to save money since they offered and we live close to the campus I'm gonna go to but now they're saying they're not sure if they wanna help me anymore and I was told "have fun trying to cover your dorm expenses with your financial aid because we're not gonna help you pay for it." Like they're testing if I'll actually leave. I'm fucking confused and trapped. Shit fucking sucks man I'm really hurt.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not a good day.
neutral	Death of the Author stems from the fact that meaning is constructed by the reader. That is, meaning does not exist unless someone creates it; words are not words (that is, symbols that carry meaning) unless someone's interpretting them as such. Therefore, the meaning a reader assigns *is* what it means. It might not agree with what the author is saying, but it still exists. Since we're working off a system of shared signs, we'll come up with similar interpretations, but... Really, even an interpretation that perfectly matched the author's intent in every way would be its own separate thing, since it's created in someone else's mind. That means that there can't be any such thing as a "wrong" interpretation. I think of a book as a like a blueprint for creating your own work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had trouble grasping this when I first learned it in college, but when I put it together with previous experiences and thoughts... I've always gotten deeply invested in shipping, and would take it really hard when my preferred pairings didn't work out (haha, "would," as if I'm any different now). I noticed this divergence, where... It was obvious that the intention going into the work was one thing, but the characters I knew felt differently, and that wasn't something I could change. When I started thinking about where the reality of those characters lay... Well, I mean, it was less thinking than something I just knew: their thoughts and feelings were really my thoughts and feelings. So, even if my versions of characters were inspired by the writers' versions, they were really separate entities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, authors often put implications or contradictions into works that they didn't intend but are nonetheless there. Like... I remember hearing this old Korean folk tale about this girl who has a blind father. Despite his wishes, she goes off on a journey to find medicine to cure him. She almost dies at sea, but is saved miraculously, and ends up marrying a prince. Her father is invited to the wedding, and he's in sad shape because he thinks his beloved daughter is dead. But she's able to cure him of his blindness, and he sees she's still alive, and everyone lives happily ever after. The moral of the story is about filial piety. However... Maybe this is just because I'm American, but I feel like the story practically deconstructs itself. The fact that magic is required for a happy ending implies that that is *not* how it would work in real life. Since we see how devastated the father when he thought he lost his daughter... To me, the story really shows how harmful self-sacrifice can be; sometimes the best thing you can do for others is to take care of yourself. Morality tales and propoganda often call attention to their own flaws like that.
neutral	This has been bugging me for such a long time. Every time I see these posts I'm filled with sadness of the good old days, and anger of the fact those days are gone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My grandparents owned a large chunk of and island with 4 cabins in Georgian Bay. This was their cottage, and their children and grandchildren were able to go up any time they wanted in the summer. And we did. My grandparents loved having everyone up, and everyone loved being up there. The big dock, the kayaks, the boat the grandkids could use whenever they wanted, the cool water, the beautiful sunsets, this place was heaven. When it was my grandparents cottage, their 3 kids were equal in how many times you could go up, the rules were the same, and everyone was welcome whenever they wanted.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Everything changed when my grandparents passed away. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My grandfather had cancer which took over his body quickly. So while he was still alive he put the cottage on sale, and we all went up one more time. It was nice closure. We all said our goodbyes to this place that held so many memories in our hearts. And then my aunt and uncle decided to buy it. They promised everyone nothing would change, we could all go up whenever we wanted, etc. But that wasn't realistic. Their kids, my cousins, have first dibs when it comes to going up. If their kids bring friends, there's no room for the other 2 families. If my aunt and uncle bring their friends, same thing applies. I don't have an issue with this, because it's their cottage. What I have an issue with is the constant stream of Instagram stories and posts every weekend of them renovating cabins, photos of the sunsets, or photos of them relaxing on the dock. Recently they posted a photo of them driving around in a boat that was so sentimental to my grandfather he never let any drive it. And there they were in bikinis and drinks sitting on the back driving it around. Seeing all of this makes me upset. They have every right to enjoy their own cottage, but it's just insensitive of them to constantly post about their great weekends up there when the other 2 families who used to enjoy the same things only get to see it through a smartphone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I just wish they would be able to enjoy their new cottage without having to show all of us how much fun they're having. Without showing us how each cabin is now one child's mini house. How a cottage which could hold over 20 people can now only fit 8. I want to forget about this place, but I can't. I'm constantly being reminded of my grandparents and feeling huge waves of nostalgia.
neutral	[linebreak] The most infuriating thing Bernie's ever said is probably [this video.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mediaite.com/online/heres-that-time-bernie-sanders-bellowed-ive-said-black-50-times-at-black-audience-and-why/amp/) At a speaking engagement in 2016, a woman said that black people in America face specific forms of oppression that other races do not, and she asked to speak about what he would do to help black people specifically. He interrupted her and said  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >"You and I may have a disagreement on this," Sanders said, "because it's not just black, and it is Latino, there are areas in America, including poor rural areas, where it is white. Okay?"  [linebreak]  [linebreak] He seriously told a black woman he disagrees with her on racism! He told her they had a disagreement on her own life experiences! [linebreak]  [linebreak] The fact that [he thinks class is more important than race](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/22/bernie-sanders-identity-politics-class-race-debate) just displays a poor understanding of both issues.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Another classic example of Bernie's deliberate cluelessness when it comes to race is is [this series of tweets](https://mobile.twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/794941635931099136) in which, three days before the election in 2016, he said Trump supporters are not racist and everyone else has a responsibility to reach out the Trump supporters and build a better society for them.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Another great example was when he said ["There are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African-American."](https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-on-andrew-gillium-and-stacey-abrams-many-whites-uncomfortable-voting-for-black-candidates).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] My personal favorite, which is to say least favorite, is the time that an audience member at one of his appearances said she wants to become the second Latina Senator in US history, and he cut her off to say ["It's not good enough for somebody to say 'hey I'm a Latina vote for me' that is not good enough."](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/94221972)  [linebreak]  [linebreak] One that's less serious but still deeply concerning to me personally is this [piece of creative writing from him where he describes a woman being bound and gang-raped in graphic detail. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2015/5/28/8682503/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy) I really just don't trust men who fantasize about abusing women. In my own experience, that fantasy belies some pretty violent subconscious sexism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] [This video](https://mobile.twitter.com/mgranville1/status/1091772831401234432) where he calls Asian people "yellows" is also pretty great.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] He also got Trump elected because [Russian propagandists helped him and his campaign ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/348051002). There's a reason that Russian trolls knew his voters would be willing to not vote for Hillary in the general. He built a coalition of racist white leftists just like Donald Trump did on the right.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The best evidence that Bernie is racist might just be the fact that in the 2016 primary, [he received 23.1% of votes from black voters and Hillary Clinton won 75.9%](http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/how-clinton-won/). Black people tend to dislike racism.
neutral	The 9/11 Vore Conspiracy argues that the twin towers were not hit by planes externally. Instead, planes were built inside the towers, and continually inflated which eventually caused a collapse. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The anonymous theorist, reviewing footage of the 9/11 attack, stops the footage numerous times to point out "weak zones" of the town that gave in as a response to the increasing weight of the internal aircraft. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He highlights areas in the footage that portray people and objects being violently thrown out of the windows with force, as well as small billows of steam and fire, happening at the lower floor levels of one of the towers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Look at this shit. You're telling me there's just random ass explosions going on? Down here? We ain't even remotely close to where the plane collided. Bull fucking horse shit.' [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The theorist explains that the planes were built by "crazed U.S. government scientists who watched too much Doctor Who, it was like that of a real life TARDIS experiment".  [linebreak]  [linebreak] "They built these massive towers, for what? Business? Hell nah, have you seen the economy pre-9/11? It was shit. We didn't have the money nor energy for no goddamn tower of that size, and definitely not two." [linebreak]  [linebreak] We asked why the experiment would take place in the middle of a city as crowded as NYC. The theorist responded: [linebreak]  [linebreak] "It's hidden in plain sight. NYC's got all the resources in the world, right at your disposal. Nah, seriously man, look at these streets, there's a fuckin' garbage pile up just down the road. You know what kind of technology you can find in these piles? There's some fuckin' money to be made. Plus you get to make a nationwide scare if your experiment fucks up, and publicity means more money. They had all to gain and nothing to lose." [linebreak]  [linebreak] The theorist explains that any and all footage taken inside the Twin Towers pre-9/11 was simply simulated, props, or illusion. Footage of NYC recorded in a position respective to which the twin towers overlooked, was created via a clever series of mirrors originally sourcing from the "432 Park Avenue" building. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The theorist claims that any and all footage of the planes are "so fake, it's laughable", he states: "Nobody saw any planes... not in real life. Outside of what the TV stations would tell you, not a single soul saw an actual, physical plane hit the buildings. Hell, you could ask everyone in New York today, you won't find a single person who saw a plane."

neutral	Here's my view: [linebreak]  [linebreak] In one way, you're correct: There is no death, because you're not your body. The essence of you, what is sometimes called the mind-stream, abides. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We have the taxonomy upside down: The basis of all that is experienced is mind, which, much like space, is ephemeral and cannot be easily pointed to, yet it is the very expanse in which phenomena occur. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We tend to accept the notion of the primacy of matter, but that's an a priori assumption and contradicts empiricism (long, long debate). Consciousness does not arise from matter; perceived matter arises from consciousness. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We find this appreciation in many spiritual traditions: The kingdom of god is within you, you have Buddha-nature, all is the Tao yet the Tao is nothing etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Quantum physicicst Max Planck said it in another way: [linebreak]  [linebreak] "All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force... We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter." [linebreak]  [linebreak] As for our bodies and everything else in this world, it doesn't matter what you believe. It actually seems a lot of people don't really accept they will die, at least not in a very visceral way, and not in a way that very often makes us behave accordingly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There isn't even a single black swan here. Do animals know they will die? If not, why do they die if your theory is correct? [linebreak]  [linebreak] A body (and ego for that matter) is a phenomenon based on causes and conditions which exhaust themselves. It is by definition a transient and compound phenomena. Such is the nature of dualistic experience. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The path to immortality is pretty much the opposite of not believing in death as a human. Rather, it is to realize the potential we have in this form to transcend our basic ignorance of dualism and radical philosophical materialism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You might also enjoy Donald Hoffman's take on the issue of nature of consciousness and reality, though he doesn't go quite as far as I do here. [linebreak]  [linebreak] [http://themindoftheuniverse.org/play?id=Donald\_Hoffman](http://themindoftheuniverse.org/play?id=Donald_Hoffman) [linebreak]  [linebreak] The biggest conspiracy ever, I believe, is the one we perpetrate against ourselves in every moment where we identify with anything other that the pure, lucid expanse of experience, which is not only our ultimate and absolute nature, but also the only thing we can know without a doubt exists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At this point, for the vast majority of us, our consciousness and experience misapprehends itself and splits all phenomena into a subject-object duality, which is a prequisite for the experience of causality, the functioning of which is what we perceive as time.
neutral	It's the hypocrisy/lack of empathy here that really gets me. She mentions being extremely uncomfortable around the large, boisterous 20-somethings staying in her neighbor's apartment (completely understandable given her trauma), but can't see why her elderly neighbors similarly aren't comfortable with a large dog running around in the hallways of their apartment complex off-leash. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Even if OP is willing to stake her reputation on the temperament of her pet, the _threat_ of a large dog wandering around that might without notice jump at/play rough with you in ways that are acceptable with 19-year olds but not with geriatrics is a detriment to her neighbor's quality of life. My uncle had a beautiful black lab when I was younger, sweet as could be, but we couldn't let him off-leash around my grandma because his idea of affection (leaning against you/pawing your knee for treats) were enough to knock her off balance/bruise her skin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sorry for the rant but ESAs are a real hot-button issue for me, especially dogs. There are countless people out there who benefit immensely from having a fuzzy bundle of unconditional affection in their lives, and for some that's literally all they need to get themselves together and better their lives. However, just because your dog is classified as an ESA _does not relieve you of the basic duties of being a dog owner_. That dog is not a functional member of society; it cannot feed, house or otherwise provide for itself. By bringing that animal into your life you are making a promise to it that you will provide it with all of the food, shelter, exercise, socialization, and whatever else it needs to be the best emotional support animal it can be. For a lot of people with self-worth/anxiety issues this isn't a problem; caring for your dog is a great way to build constructive habits that can lead to the confidence to tackling your own problems.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you are unable to provide this (which is _fine_ and quite possibly is no fault of your own), you need to seriously evaluate whether bringing an ESA into your home is going to help lift yourself up, or just drag your new friend down to your level. [linebreak]  [linebreak] **edit:** Wanted to clarify something because I went from "unconditional love" to "social contract" in the same paragraph: if you adopt a dog and do the _bare minimum_ to keep it alive, that thing's gonna love the shit out of you. Doesn't matter if it's overweight, sick, or whatever, that poor fuzzball doesn't know any better. If you are not doing these things as a dog owner it is my opinion that you are taking advantage of the poor animal that has placed its trust in you.
neutral	I almost did it. I almost ended myself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm in a better state of mind now, I'm safe. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But I felt unsafe. I felt lost. I did not want another breath.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A jumble of relevant info; [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am uninsured, stuck in a job I hate for the good money I make, stuck in a manipulative situation at home. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My boyfriend and I (24F) have plans to move away from everything, but even that adds to the stress that sits like an elephant on my chest. [linebreak] I'm depressed, clinically, and my anxiety runs rampant sometimes.  [linebreak] On top of that, I'm diagnosed with BPD (borderline personality disorder) and truly try to go above and beyond to not be the monster people with BPD are made out to be. [linebreak] I suffer the mood swings; the infinity on high to wanting to die in 2.5, the severe emotional reactions, the impulses. But i try to keep everything a secret, keep it inside my head. I don't want anyone to be a casualty of my emotions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My guy is very supportive; he tries to be. He's fairly critical of some things and strongly opinionated. These are things I love about him. Sometimes, when I try to express my emotions, he's logical about things; i feel like I'm better off staying silent because i end up feeling worse, through no fault of his. I feel like I'm burdening him with my emotional distress, and that maybe I articulate poorly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So i do. I say everything is fine. I pushed my friends away because of work taking all my time, and my fear of being an emotional burden  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I try to work through it on my own. To stay rational. I don't want to be a monster. People say that those with BPD are egocentric narcissistic monsters. I don't want to be like that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But by hiding it I feel so fake. Like nobody knows who I am. Maybe I don't know who I am.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I wanted to be done. I think about suicide often, but I always find a reason not to. I try to have a will to live. I crave affection and appreciation but feel like a leech asking for it, so I try not to. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I didn't kill myself. But i almost do, a lot.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  In the end, it comes down to who would feed my cats? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have to. So I strive on and try for better days. I'll beat this. I have to. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thanks for listening. I just, needed to tell someone I almost killed myself last night. But I didn't.  [linebreak]
neutral	During the GFC the big four central banks - The Federal Reserve, The ECB (Europe), BOJ (Japan) and PBoC (China) began the process of quantitative easing which is ultimately just printing money but instead of just printing money and giving it out to everyone to spend they directed all the money into the banking system which was then used to loan out at extremely cheap prices for people to buy assets. This is why we have an "everything bubble" right now. And why real estate values in many cities have gone extremely high.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Last year the big four central banks stopped this money printing process and started raising interest rates which caused global asset markets to start crashing as the banks no longer had endless money to lend out they had to "tighten lending standards". In Canada they said it was the new "mortgage stress test laws", in the UK they said it was "brexit uncertainty", in Australia they said it was "the royal commission into the banks", and in the US they said it was a mix of Fed rate hikes and US-China trade talks. All these events across the globe conveniently had the same impact at the same time in their respective countries which just so happened to occur when the central banks ended Quantitative Easing (money printing).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It looked like everything was crashing up until December 2018 however come January global asset markets suddenly revived. That's because the Chinese central bank (PBoC) started printing billions of dollars again: https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/01/16/chinas-central-bank-injects-record-amount-to-stimulate-economy.html [linebreak]  [linebreak] However the central banks have a problem and that is the Modern Monetary Theory movement:   [linebreak] https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2019-01-17/modern-monetary-theory-would-sink-u-s-in-debt [linebreak]  [linebreak] The lower classes have woken up to all this endless money being printed to prop up the assets of the elite and now want a piece of the pie. They are saying "if you can print endless money to inflate stock markets and real estate you can print endless money to pay for healthcare and infrastructure". The central banking cartel cannot have this for obvious reasons. It is at that moment where the global financial markets will crash and WW3 will begin in order to create a distraction as to the instability caused by the central banking system.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We are not at that point just yet as the Central Banks are still able to perform QE without question from the MSM but when it becomes obvious to the masses that this is simply printing money to prop up asset markets and should be used for social services and middle class citizens struggling with mortgage repayments this is when the MSM will draw attention to how unsustainable QE is and it will all end in a devastating debt driven crash.

neutral	Does this count as [off my meta] if I'm complaining about stuff on this sub? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Based on my own personal experience and other posts I've seen, I would argue there is a real problem with people attacking the OP for venting views they do not like. I get this isn't a safe space for any specific groups and I'm not saying people can't disagree with what someone is venting about. I've gotten into it quite a bit with some people's venting here, like them hating an entire group of people because of the actions of a few. However, far too often do I notice people resort to personal attacks, aka ad hominem fallacy. Not to mention this violates rule 4 of this sub. I suspect the reason this rule is in place is to stop this sort of thing. Attack the argument, not the person. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Basically, instead of people addressing why they disagree with what someone is venting about, they often try to discredit the person by making claims like "you're not really X" or "you're fake and a troll". That's not to say trolling doesn't happen here, but often, disagreeing with someone's venting is treated as if that person is just trying to get a rise out of people. It's like people refuse to believe someone could have unpopular opinions and stand by them, no, they *must* be trolling. It's very closed minded too, because the person making the troll claim refuses to think outside of their world view. For example, if you're a racial minority, some people have a hard time believing you if you don't fall into stereotypical views for your race. Is it so hard to believe someone can have opinions you don't like and that they believe in them? If they really are trolling, you replying to them just fuels their fire. It's so unproductive to vent if all people are going to do is accuse you of being this or not being that, effectively going against the purpose of this sub. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Given that the purpose of this sub is to allow opinions and venting that OffMyChest wouldn't allow, I would expect better of people here. I dare say if you want a sub like this where people get auto banned from posting in specific subs that OffMyChest mods don't like, that sub is much more of a fit for you than hanging around here trying to dogpile people who go against your world views. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, disagree with me on this if you must, but I think it would be better to debunk my arguments rather than claim I'm a fake and thus, that alone is somehow supposed to invalidate everything I've written.

neutral	CHESTERFIELD COUNTY, Va. (WRIC) — A Chesterfield family spoke with 8News Friday after fending off a naked intruder who broke into their home on South Twilight Lane the night before. The intruder claimed to be the devil and attacked the family, prompting the homeowner to fire 39 rounds. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The incident was a traumatic experience for the Lewis family's first night in their brand new home. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] "She was in to kill us," Melissa Lewis said. "That was her almighty, to kill us. She attacked us and I held her down just kept on punching her and punching her as hard as I possibly could." [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Lewis' dream home now looks like a war zone, with blood soaked into the carpet, the walls and windows riddled with bullets and shell casings scattered all over. [linebreak]  [linebreak] "I said 'who are you?" Lewis' husband, who did not wish to go on camera, explained. "She said 'I need your help, please help me.' I said 'get out of my house,' and she goes 'I'm the devil.'" [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The homeowner says the woman, who had a blue ponytail, broke into the basement around 10:30 p.m. on July 4. The family said she was laughing menacingly and refused to leave. [linebreak]  [linebreak] "She looked possessed, her eyes were completely black, like saucers, and she was laughing like it was a joke," Lewis's husband told 8News. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Fearing for his life, the father of three grabbed his pistol and gave a verbal warning to the woman. With his family sleeping upstairs, he opened fire hoping to scare her off. None of the shots struck the suspect.

neutral	If you're under the impression that vaccines are safe for everyone and don't cause injury and death, then you're either uninformed, in denial, or outright lying at this juncture.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Since the first vaccines were created for smallpox, doctors knew and it was firmly established that brain inflammation, permanent brain damage and death have always been among most serious complications with vaccinations. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just in case you weren't aware of it the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was passed precisely because the number of lawsuits being filed against the vaccine manufactures for vaccine injuries and the losses they were incurring when they were consistently found to be guilty and held responsible for those injuries and personal damages in court was jeopardizing both their profits and even their continued existence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You want to begin this conversation, that's where it should commence from. Also take not that vaccines are not considered to be "drugs" nor are they held to the same rigorous and lengthy scientific testing that is applied to them, their efficacy, and any potential side-effects or long term effects that result from them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] By 1986 both Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court had declared vaccines to be "unavoidably unsafe" and proceeded to deliberately shield the drug companies from any and all product liability for the vaccines they made and sold.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you or your child was injured or died after a vaccination, you couldn't hold the drug company that made and profited from it or anyone who regulates, promotes, administers or mandates the vaccine accountable in a civil court of law in front of a jury of your peers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now anyone with product safety liability can be sued when any flaws in that products design or construction results in harm to any unsuspecting person that used and relied on them but not the vaccine manufacturers. Doctors can also be sued for malpractice **except** when they administer vaccinations that cause an injury or kill someone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Vaccines are the only product that the government both mandates and completely indemnifies with the over 3 billion already paid out in compensation for the serious injuries that have been proven to have been directly caused by them being charged back to the taxpayers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now it should be patently obvious that the more vaccines that are administered to individual children the greater the likelihood that those kind of injuries are going to take place among them and  that is precisely what has happened and is increasingly happening.

I mean, Google is saying they're going to rig search engine results and YouTube trending charts to avoid another Trump term... And even dishonest reasons sometimes. They don't have to tell the truth, they can do terrible things that screw the working class, they can wage unjust wars, they can take money from shady sources, and what are we going to do? It's like they're taunting us with that: "Yeah, I just screwed you over, and everybody knows it was me. And I already have billions, but I felt like having a little bit more. And everybody knows I have all your information already. And nobody cares. What are you going to do about it?" Kinda like how Google got rid of the euphemisms, and straight up started admitting banning people they don't like: "ALT RIGHT!" Hmm... You know what that sounds like? Jewish people. Only instead of stars of David, they'd better have their Democrat memberships on them, they're going to start banning more and more conservatives now, or they're going to be calls to their employers to fire them from their jobs, and their kids are going to be starving on dirt floors getting assaulted by Cultural Marxists accusing them of misogyny and white supremacy.

neutral	You've disrupted my thoughts for a while. Each time it happens, my mind melts. Its dominated by thoughts of you. It's like an attack, one I can't fight. I can't sleep or otherwise function. I can't deal with it 90% of the time. I just have to let it pass and hope it doesn't come back when I'm at my most vulnerable. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I resent you for it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You ruined about 90% of my music playlist. I can only listen to songs with neutral themes and no mention of love or romantic relationships. I have no clue how I failed to notice that romance was the main theme for a while in music history. But there it is and you plague it along with my thoughts. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I resent you for it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sometimes I wonder why we're even friends at this point in time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe its because I still think I have a chance. But you yourself said you didn't want it because of distance and other drama at that time in your life. I let it go. You're your own person. That's fine. Be with whoever you want. And yet you're keeping me as a friend in spite of how I feel. You know how I feel. And yet you're keeping me around for... what? Validation that life keeps dealing you a shit hand and you can't handle it without getting another person to agree with you? Maybe you value me for some reason? Maybe you're keeping me around for some unfathomable reason, I dunno. Whatever the case... I think its malicious. I can't even tell anymore. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I resent you for it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm trying to move on with life and you made my journey damn near impossible. I couldn't even date others without dealing with the thoughts of you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I resent you for it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You should've let me go the moment you told me someone took advantage of your newly single status. You didn't let me go. You know how I felt. Sure, I would've been hurt and in pain, but I wouldn't have been in as much pain as I am right now. You seem happy and you didn't even see what I saw when you told me you had someone new. You knew them for a shorter time than anyone else and suddenly they're your new someone? You're a hypocrite. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I resent you for it.
neutral	This may be too strong of an emotional response for something like this, but it's a huge pet peeve of mine. Keep your filthy hands out of my product; theres a scoop right there if you want to sample something! The store owner doesnt want anyone to sample anything, but I don't care: people will do it anyway and if they feel they can't they'll do it on the sly with their bare hands (more than they do now). [linebreak]  [linebreak] I mean, you people realize that others are going to buy this stuff too right? Would you really want to buy some candy or mixed nuts that you knew people had been touching all day? No you wouldn't because thats fucking gross, unsanitary, and slightly nauseating. I used to care enough to stop people, but I quickly learned (on my first day) that if I dropped what I was doing to stop folks from sticking their hands in my product I would never get any work done. It's seriously an all day thing and often happens back to back. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Shame on you woman who sneezed into her hand and then grabbed some almonds. Don't think I didnt see you, guy who wiped his nose on the back of his hand and then later stuck it in multiple bins. Don't even get me started on all the bad parents who don't keep an eye on their kids who then run around my department and end up plunging their hands (sometimes entire arms) into the candy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] While I'm here complaining: screw you people that have mixed up multiple nuts together in a large bag and then attempt to fool the cashier into thinking they are all the same price. We are not stupid and now I have to spend the next hour separating all the nuts one by one so I can put them back. Or the people who fill up bags, change their minds (while eating from the bag), and then stuff the entire thing into a random bin because you know I'll put it back properly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, fuck your cherry pits, gum, pistachio shells and whatever else you have stuck into your mouths and spit on my floor without any consideration of the fact THAT A HUMAN BEING HAS TO PICK THESE THINGS UP I DO NOT WANT TO TOUCH WHATEVER HAD BEEN IN YOUR DIRTY ASS MOUTH GLOVES OR NOT. FUCK. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Animals, the lot of them.
neutral	Hey! I don't think you are a loser :) [linebreak]  [linebreak] I think by making this post it shows you do want to change, and by having regret over not doing things at the end of the year it shows you want to change as well. That is important, if you don't really have the drive to grow, then you aren't going to.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't know where you live, but perhaps there is a community center, or a park? A place for you to walk? Going to a center or a park where there are people could help you make friends, and get exercise as well. If you don't know how to break the ice with someone, giving them a compliment might work, or asking them a question about something they have with them (like, "oh that's a cool phone, what kind is it?"). Take the conversation from there (if they seem comfortable with the confrontation). You can't make friends if you don't put yourself out there at least a little.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also don't know your interests, but go to places where you can find people with similar ones. If you go to a store that has things that interest you, even talking to the employees could help. They probably have an interest in the thing too, and they have to be welcoming to customers, so it is good practice to try talking to them if you are still uncomfortable with the idea of making friends. Also, chatting with people online leads to more practice as well as online friends that can be there for you! [linebreak]  [linebreak] For losing weight, start simple. Don't tell yourself you are going to start going to the gym everyday if you don't think you will, and don't feel bad for knowing how much you can or can't handle. Again, I don't know how chubby you are, but you know yourself. Take a walk everyday, introduce one healthy food into your life (or take away one unhealthy food) every week if diet is a problem for you. And let yourself have a cheat day, it can help you in the long run. If you are scared to work out in public, buy some weights of your own and watch some Netflix while lifting them. Make it somewhat enjoyable so you stick with it, so ooh don't get discouraged for not wanting to follow through. I believe in you!  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Good luck to you, friend :D

neutral	A year ago I told my sister I was unsafe and took an Uber to a mental ward for the 7th (8?) time. I had been to this one once before and as soon as I walked in the ward I felt safe again. It was home. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of the counselors there and I got very close. I'm ashamed to say he was everything I looked for in a person, not even in a sex/love way.As a kid I dreamed about a knight in shining armor, and he was exactly that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He would talk to me personally every night, staying after his shift ended. I remember one night opening up to him about the abuse after all patients had gone to bed. He stayed so late that night, and I told him "go home. You have a kid." He told me "I'm not leaving until I know you're safe. Those people are never allowed to visit. We'll report them together. I always knew there was more you weren't telling me, and now everything makes sense. It's okay. You're safe here, and I'm not letting anything else happen to you." He said he didn't do all this for anyone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Locked wards have very strict rules, and I broke them frequently. I slowly got all privileges taken away for multiple incidents. I would sleep in a chair next to the nurses station. I was only allowed to use crayons, since I abused pens.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] But this counselor bent the rules and I was allowed to have my guitar. He knew how to play and would hold down the strings for me so I could have a capo. I played for relaxation most nights, and other patients would stay up just to listen. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Before I left, he told me "the only way I'm ever allowed to hear about you, or see you on the news is if you get famous for music." Meaning, he didn't want to hear that I had killed myself.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's been so long, but sometimes I pray to him. I hope he gets the message and knows somehow I'm still breathing. I want him to know I've kept my promise. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I love him so much it hurts to hear his name, and I will never tell anyone because they think it's a crush. It's more than that. He saved me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thank you. If you're out there somewhere.
neutral	You were their hero, and I'll never be able to explain to them why you didn't think I was worth loving, and why they were so easy for you to use as pawns against me. I'll never be able to explain how broken you are, and that it wasn't them, and isn't me that made you do what it is you are doing to them. We're all broken in this world. We are all screwed up. The only thing that distinguishes us from one another is that some of us are brave enough to try and face who we are, in order to change for the better. I'll never be able to make them not hurt when they think about you. You won't ever be able to undo what pain you caused them, and me, out of your own fear and desperation to heal yourself. You can find a new wife, and take new kids under your wing. You can get that education degree, and lead the youth of the world. You can be everyone else's hero in the whole world. You can blame me for all of it, you can justify every action, but you won't *ever* escape the demons that haunt you. The ones in your heart that get louder any time you allow the anger to fade. The ones that will always remind you that there are 2 children who you failed. The 2 that were your favorite on this Earth. The 2 who believed you were their hero in life, that trusted you implicitly, who *knew* you'd always put them first. You shattered their hearts, and changed their lives forever. It won't matter how many more you help. You failed the ones who would have been there for you forever. The 2 that mattered most to you. You will always know what horrors you are capable of carrying out, so you will forever doubt if you can ever do better. You will always know that you used your own children as weapons to hurt a person who never meant to hurt you. A person you loved. You may tell yourself lies on the surface, you may convince yourself that you did the best you could.... But you will *know.* Everything you achieve, every commendation you receive, every time a person sings your praises, it will be overshadowed by your regret. Because underneath all those justifications, lies a little boy who is terrified of what he has become.

Lyft and Uber have taken it further where the consumer themselves can be rated based on their behavior with the driver. Same thing with delivery apps or online shopping/ bartering apps. Not to mention, Apple has admittedly been rating its users based on their interactions with their devices both positive and negative. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  Watch. It's going to be completely voluntary, at first. I think Facebook will initiate. It will seem like a game and those who participate will rate one another in real time and then companies will start to offer discounts or perks to those who have good ratings. All in GOOD FUN THOUGH! [linebreak]  [linebreak] It will all be downhill from there. Fart accidentally in a quiet meeting, lower rating. Get angry with the desk clerk, bad rating. Question authority, really bad rating. Accumulate enough "infractions" and your travel pass is denied. Employment terminated, the possibilities are endless...and terrifying.

neutral	This is mostly just for my peace of mind but here goes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A few years ago I met a girl, we'll call her Margo, who was amazing in a million ways.  She was musical, beautiful, kind, funny, intelligent, and she was not my wife.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] While my marriage was on the rocks at the time, and my wife wasn't around very much, we were still married.  It was a very dark time for me, but Margo was like a massive light that enveloped me and reminded me of who I was. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I think it's worth mentioning that Margo and I never slept together, however we absolutely developed real, and deep feelings for each other. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, eventually my wife finds out I've been connecting with Margo, and is (rightfully) furious.  There were a few tear filled nights, and some very hard conversations, but in the end, we decided to work things out.  I unceremoniously, (and with much difficulty and hesitation) ended contact with Margo.  I still feel horrible about how this all happened because she really was an amazing person who didn't deserve any of the drama I brought upon her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, my wife and I work things out, and things are better than they've ever been between us.  We re-found the love we had somehow lost, and are stronger because of everything that happened.  That being said, there was still always a part of me that was just.... empty and regretful.  Not because of how things turned out but because of the way they happened.  I was also worried about Margo, because for a long time I was her sounding board, and now, I couldn't help her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Tonight I randomly decided to google Margo, and there was a video of her singing a brand new song, and parts of it were too specific to not be about what happened between us, but it gave me closure that everything is alright now. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's late and I'm tired but happy. Even though this is a throwaway account I'm hoping this post just gets buried in the "New" pile. This was more for me than anything, because I don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff, and posting it here feels like talking about it.  If you read this far, congratulations determined reader. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR   Not really interesting.
neutral	My friend (let's call her C) was basically one of my first friends in college, and she's helped me through a lot of tough shit (depression, anxiety, losing a family member, losing a friend). I've known her since sophomore year, and now we're both seniors. I'm graduating in 2.5 months, but she's staying for a 5th year. Most of my friends are juniors or staying for a 5th year, so it's going to be really tough for me to leave my friends behind. My college friends are like my family. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've also helped C through a nasty breakup with one of her previous girlfriends. Because of this, I was happy for her when she got her new girlfriend last year, but now I think things have gotten weird. [linebreak]  [linebreak] She literally spends all her time with her girlfriend. Like always. Even though C lives with just one other dude, her girlfriend is practically her third roommate, and I know this pisses off C's actual roommate. C's girlfriend doesn't go to college and just lives in the same town we go to school in. [linebreak]  [linebreak] C has just gradually stopped talking to me. She even killed our ~600 day snapchat streak a few months ago for practically no reason. Sometimes she'll randomly send me a meme or two on Facebook and I'll try to start a conversation with her, but 95% of the time the conversation ends with her leaving me on read. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sometimes, I'll see C's other friends around on campus and they'll ask me if I've ever heard from C, because they haven't. Because of this I know this isn't something C's just doing to me, but she's doing this to all her friends. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm happy that C is happy in her relationship, but I'm hurt that she's practically cut off myself and all of her other friends. Since I'm graduating in a few months, I want to spend as much time with all of my friends as possible before I leave campus. I haven't seen her in months, and I'm worried that if she doesn't get her shit together, I may not see her again before I graduate [linebreak]  [linebreak] **Thanks for reading.

neutral	**Context** [linebreak]  [linebreak] This subreddit focuses on the Duggars, an American fundamentalist Christian family with 19 children from the same parents. This denomination of Christianity is extremely strict. Most of the women only wear skirts below the knee, the children are homeschooled, and they reject modern music and media. The Duggar family had a reality television show called \*19 Kids and Counting\*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters. A new show, called \*Counting On\*, focuses on just the adult children and their lives after the scandal. Both of the TV shows used to have their own subreddits, but they became mostly inactive. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] This subreddit drama focuses on r/DuggarsSnark, a subreddit created to make snark about the Duggar family. However, there has been discussion between members on the subreddit concerning what constitutes snark and what constitutes "leghumping." Leghumping is fawning over or praising the Duggars, which is not allowed on the sub. Some people believe positive observations (ex: Her hair looks better than usual) or explaining behavior (ex: Is it normal to eat casserole all the time? Yes, that is normal in some regions) are forms of leghumping, while other people do not believe so.

neutral	Great, so you get to live longer and be brought into an environment of destitute and poverty as a Cuban. And this idea that the Cuban government cares for its citizens is ridiculous. The government doesn't give a shit. The incredibly dedicated and selfless Cuban doctors, Cuban citizens themselves, are the ones that are caring for their fellow citizens. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, how does the Cuban government treat its doctors? Well, since all these Cuban doctors are basically government property, they're exported out to make money for the government. What's the cut that these doctors receive from their respective host countries? [linebreak]  [linebreak] https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48214513 [linebreak]  [linebreak] > According to a report by Prisoners Defenders, a Spain-based NGO that campaigns for human rights in Cuba and is linked to the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) opposition group, **doctors on average receive between 10% and 25% of the salary paid by the host countries,** with the rest being kept by Cuba's authorities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But in monetary terms, that's actually a pretty damn good prospect for these doctors, because: [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The wages on offer were another strong incentive for Dayli, who is originally from the small Cuban city of Camagüey, to join up. Going from a doctor's salary on the island of just $15 a month in 2011, she says she was paid $125 monthly for the first six months in Venezuela, a figure that rose to $250 after six months and $325 during her third year. Her family in Cuba also received a bonus of $50 a month. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This pittance is considered a "strong incentive." You can sit on your ass in front of a computer doing "beer money work" and make several times more than what these doctors make. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Of course, the Cuban government doesn't really care too much where these doctors are sent: [linebreak]  [linebreak] > But according to a new report, some of the doctors themselves say conditions can be nightmarish - controlled by minders, subject to a curfew and posted to extremely dangerous places, James Badcock reports. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You also don't get to bring your family with you as you're shipped out. And you have no say in any of this. [It is almost like slavery.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/world/americas/brazil-cuban-doctors-revolt.html) [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, is this what caring looks like?
neutral	>I really wish we could get to the genesis of the hatred of bigger people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As with all societal trends it's complicated but I think media plays the most significant role.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Movies, TV, advertising... everyone looks a certain way. Even non visual mediums like books and radio will *describe* people as having these certain looks.  And heck, you can see this even in how very body-positive overweight people dress/do their makeup.... they're still copying all the styles popularized by people of a more normal weight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't think that makes the body positive overweight people hypocrites though, which people will want to do... instead I think it just shows how unbelievably pervasive media and societal perceptions of beauty really are. Even a person claiming to be body positive will have makeup that mimics what you might see on a celebrity.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is an element of health involved. No doubt, being overweight is generally less healthy... obesity is not the way the human body naturally should end up... but I think that's so buried beneath the cultural elements that I find it generally hard to believe most people when they claim their fat people hate comes from beliefs about health and wellness.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >The average size of Americans has gotten larger overall, yet there seems to be a particular hatred for big people I cant wrap my head around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I actually have noticed less hatred for fat people in the past 5 years or so, perhaps owing to the increasing size of Americans. At this moment, some 2/3rds of Americans are overweight or obese.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] However, there's also an element one commenter pointed out that is clearly on display in this AITA post: self-hate/self-loathing... the overweight girl very likely is quite ashamed and sensitive about her size and is using the sassy, in-your-face body positivity as a cover... and I'm sure that many of the people shitting on fat people online are themselves overweight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  >Mysogyny is wrapped up in it as well of course. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Absolutely. Especially I think in the sort of middle-range of being bigger... if you're slightly overweight as a guy, it's much more acceptable than being slightly overweight as a girl.  [linebreak]
neutral	We have been fighting for a while. Arguments and fights because you met a small part of me that was truly myself and uninfluenced by anyone other than you. I was alone and i was scared but i had you at the time and everything was okay. But then i moved home... [linebreak]  [linebreak] I moved home and everything changed. I was influenced by my surroundings and i changed into someone you despised and detested. You hated it because you saw the kind of person i could be and you saw the true me. Now, all you saw was the constant stress, the anger, the sadness, you saw me being unhappy and in my unhappiness, i took it out on you. I took it out on you all the time. The more i did it the more we fought.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You begged and pleaded with me to go back to the person you fell in love with. I tried. I was hyperconcious of the way i was treating you and the way i tried to word things. I struggled a lot. Slowly i began to understand what you were trying to tell me. Things slowly began to get better but then i would revert. For a little bit we were okay. For a little bit i thought we would make it. Them you got sick and i got a taste for what it was like when we didnt argue all the time. In your 2 week sickness i found peace.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yesterday was Valentine's Day. It was also the end of our relationship. We broke up last night. I feel like I have a giant hole in my heart. i have a void i feel like i could never fill and no one will ever come close to ever replacing you. The loneliness feels like its swollowing me up. I feel like a broken crumbling shell of what used to be a person. Even through all our fights and all our arguing, one thing never changed. I still consider you to be someone I deeply admire and care for and someone I consider my world. You are still someone important to me thar i love with every ounce of my being... But you'll never be mine again.
neutral	I definitely think there is something going on at the poles.... If u look at other planets like Saturn or Jupiter they got lots of weird activity at the poles like the giant hexagon/Saturn or swastika/Jupiter. I'm sure there is stuff at the poles that is censored. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, think of some of the more sketchy or "Illuminati/Mason" linked countries at the far South, there is Argentina which was a Nazi refuge, South Africa which was the main African country that Euro imperial/colonists kept and didn't give back, and Australia/new Zealand the old prison colony which has that huge s spy base to monitor those t data cables. It's like they are the gatekeepers to Antarctica.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I like the idea of things like Mount meru or some of the ideas of hollow earth, which is not what u think. Imagine multiple cones/pyramids , some inverted and stacked onto each other, like those Russian dolls that have smaller versions inside, which fits with the idea of afractal based earth. But anyways, I think there is a cone or cylinder type tunnel that runs from South to North, and helps too channel or recycle the atmosphere or electro magnetic energy, and spits it out in the North to make the Aurora Northern lights. Just think of how your body has one huge tube, your inner gut lining, and the North pole is the asshole farting out green particles. The asshole being in the North and not the South plays intro the whole inversion stuff, at least that's how I see it since it seems like more focus is always put on the North and South pole barely getss mentioned.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I would not be surprised if there is tropical land in Antarctica, possibly on a plateau, as well as North Canada which has some bizarre stories as well as a very odd and interesting gravity anomaly. There is also a few Islands in the South that are super curious, including one in the Indian Ocean between Africa and Australia that is barely noticeable on maps but rumored to be a CIA base as there is a ton of radio and internet traffic that comes out of there and a small colony of "researchers" who live there.
neutral	First of all, I don't know if the girl even wants me as a friend. Sometimes she takes one, two days to answer my messages. But she always answers, so I guess she is at least a tiny bit interested in talking to me. Otherwise she'd already have ghosted me. However, I do recognise that I might have driven her away a bit by avoiding to see her back then. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I went to a therapist back when I was 17 to talk about this and some other, darker, things. She ended up saying that she didn't treat troubles as bad as mine, gave me another place's number & charged me anyway. I'll never go to a therapist again, since she was not the first one I went to during my life. I went to one when I was 5, another one when I was 12 and another one when I was 14. Neither one of them were able to help me at all with the issue I faced at the time (I don't quite remember why I went when I was 5 but the other two times were because of anger management issues).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Last year I thought of fixing my anxiety myself with meds since it got really bad (I got to the point of stuttering once when talking to two girls and one guy), but I couldn't find any pharmacy willing to sell them to me without a prescription so I couldn't do anything about it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't know if I like anything about myself. I'm a good friend, I guess? Back when I had friends I always stood by their side and always listened to them when they had some sort of problem. But I don't know... I was always the one initiating conversations & when I decided to let them start one I never heard from them again. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And about my life... I don't know. The only things I can come up with are material things such as not having to work like most people my age and having two cars for myself (whereas most people my age have to use public transport) but I guess these don't count. I don't have much going on.
neutral	I really wanted to not comment on this, but its incredibly frustrating when people post this comment because its so tone deaf.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] First, the Pride event started as a riot. It wasn't a happy parade with rainbows and dance music. It was a bunch or angry gays finally saying "we've had enough" and standing up to police brutality and raids on gay spaces.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Since then, the movement has endured the AIDS Crisis, and we only had each other when the government did nothing.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We created new spaces to welcome in the people who never fit into society.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And for the decades, LGBTQ+ youth have been the targets of hate crimes. They face hate speech and the fear of death in some places. Gay-youth have some of the highest rates of suicide in North America.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We have had to rally and throw our sexuality "in your face" just to fucking marry the person we love.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Gay people have been denied jobs, or fired because of their sexuality.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] For many people, pride isn't "just" about celebrating being gay, its about celebrating that DESPITE being gay, we have survived the harassment, the violence, the depression and anxiety. Its about remembering those who did the hardest of the work to get us to where we are today. So yes, we absolutely should be proud of being gay and all the baggage that has come with it. Straight people aren't attacked for being straight. You have never been denied a job for being straight. You have had the privilege of being in the majority. To marry who you love.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now, that being said there is a lot about pride that even I have issues with. But Pride reminds us of where we were and how far we've come.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] And please, for the love of God, don't come at me with "But no one cares about you being gay in 2019" because that's bullshit. The Orlando shooting happened 3 years ago. A gay man in my town was stabbed - for being gay - just last summer. There are still countries where homosexuality is illegal.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] ....and thats the end of my rant.
neutral	Guys, I am literally shaking rn. Even Oneplus' new vibrator motor which is 200% more powerful is nothing compared to me rn. My parents thought I was doing some sort of dance and were applauding when I was standing still. I am LITERALLY shaking rn. I want to get out of this country because this country is DONE. So what if people chose the ruling party? I know its not my choice, so everybody is dumb. Only I am smart. I LITERALLY want to go out of this country RIGHT NOW. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have no skills, so skill-based emigration is out of question. My education isn't that great, so merit-based emigration is out of question. I don't have enough money, so investment-based emigration is out of question. I can't study abroad because I am piss poor at studying anything, so further studies is out of question. My present employer will not recommend me to go and start work in another city, so another country is out of question. I can't get a job because I am not skilled in anything that I do, so job abroad is out of question. I can't speak any language except Hindi and English.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am really good at writing big comments on social media platforms. I can maybe do journalism by selectively picking articles that match my view point and painting a black picture for the whole country after discarding anything even remotely positive or against my opinion by calling them biased, sold-out and unethical.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I only want to emigrate to first world countries where I can be myself and be treated as a second-class citizen or be subject to racism or random gun shootings. I am willing to accept every extremist reaction in that country, because they are progressive. Please help me. After moving out, I am thinking of making youtube videos to enlighten the youth on how leaders who are so capable and young, like Raul Gandi and Mayaweighty must be chosen because #secularismFTW. (Please ignore the comments where they ask communities to come together and vote. That's NOT communal. That is secular AF.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thanks guys. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am literally shaking rn.
neutral	Stop wishing for true love, don't look at your dates harshly and cut those that don't fit the 'he's gonna be my husband' feeling. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is hard to find a man that really seems to want a serious relationship which guarantees marriage, you must know yourself how MUCH HARDER it is when half the boys don't even give you a chance.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You said that life is fleeting, enjoy every opportunity instead of chasing a prince on a horse, because whatever you might believe of yourself, you can make no good judgement on which unlikely relationship will turn into *that one*. Nobody likes incertainty, nobody likes to talk of serious shit when they don't even know the person well, even less so if they don't know the person well and the person is also someone in your case. Give every improbable relationship a chance of knowing you AND put NO pressure on it. No obe wants to hear the stranger they've been dated for 3 weeks is dead-serious about long-term commitment and has more string attached than a corset. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And in case you might start with 'You don't understand'... well, you might not actually understand it either. It is easy to be isolated, refused, frail, and to think you have had all the time in the world to know how things work. It is easy to let the hatred or spite that grows from the feeling of injustice get the better of you. It is also easy to let yourself down. The world is not as naked when you don't have the full picture, even less when you think you had it because of overthinking and over-analysing stuff.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Good things will come for you once you let yourself open. But to let yourself open you need not to let yourself down, not to think you understand the world, relationships and partners as well as you might do, and especially, you need to take the risk of losing time and offering yourself a chance with people that might not appear as commited as you wish, even if it is not what you think you want.
neutral	I think the idea of duality explains the nature of freemasonry very well. We've all heard stories about freemasons being involved in a lot of conspiracies and the like so I studied a little and I've met quite a few low level masons myself. Even thought they deny it, they have a tendency for the occult and of keeping secrets, but overall freemasonry teaches them a lot of good things. A popular myth is that Lucifer is the god of freemasonry, which is true, their version of Lucifer is that of a benevolent being who represents knowledge and truth and they believe a true mason must constantly seek knowledge for the sake of others. The same thing can't be said about the high ranking masons, who worship a lot of wicked deities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A good example of those high ranking masons could be the British royal family, like Prince William and Queen Elizabeth, because a lot of members of that family are 32-33 degree masons, the Rothschilds themselves have married with the British royals and they have married with a lot of the European noble families over time, like [the Aldobrandini family, which is part of the Italian/black nobility families.](https://saidit.net/s/conspiracy/comments/arg/the_italianblack_nobility_families/) So their wealth has grown over time. The Rothschilds were involved in [grooming Clinton for presidency months before she launched her candidacy.](https://thefreethoughtproject.com/wikileaks-rothschilds-clinton-presidency/) and they also [bailed out Trump when he almost broke his father's business](https://saidit.net/s/conspiracy/comments/79z/some_background_on_how_trump_almost_broke_his/) so they've been involved with a lot of politicians and It's safe to say a lot of those nobles I mentioned before are involved in the whole mess too. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So you see, both the stories about freemasonry being a friendly fraternity with slight occult leanings and the ones of the masons being dark occultist being involved in conspiracies are true simultaneously. That's why I consider freemasonry to be a secret society despite the fact that a lot of masons like to sell themselves as being part of an "open society". Keeping secrets is common for even the low level members and the high level members are involved in a lot of corrupt things. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What interesting facts do you know about freemasonry and other secret societies?
neutral	Ahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahaha! I spit out my coffee. Lmfao. [linebreak]       [linebreak] Hahaha.. You're right though. Not all of them. Just the richest ones. I mean, look at the dude who was in black beach prison in Equatorial Guinea when he got caught with his British mercenary team of commandos to try to stage a coup there for people like Margaret Thatcher's son and other world billionaires and corporate elite. BAHAHAHAHA. They left him there to rot until he started naming off names, then they got him the fuck out of there pretty quick after a few dozen/hundred millions of shekels. [linebreak]      [linebreak] >Simon Francis Mann is a former British Army officer and mercenary. He served part of a 34-year prison sentence in Equatorial Guinea for his role in a failed coup d'état in 2004, before receiving a presidential pardon on humanitarian grounds on 2 November 2009. [linebreak]      [linebreak] I could go all day. HSBC bank laundery mula for the cartels, etc. Law enforcement is just to keep the jails full and keep the people oppressed, but they aren't going to arrest some douche sack for flying his 10 lb's of personal cocaine to his condo overseas on his private jet - well he might get a slap on the wrist, but you or I would be looking at life. The top banks and businesses are all above the law, to think otherwise is hilarious. Maybe some shit hole country would try to enforce their law on someone to get publicity to their shithole country but it would be shortlived, and would just be more publicity for said rich person that they could write a book about and make millions more. [linebreak]      [linebreak] I have nothing against rich people. I'm from an upper middle class family and I've lived poor on my own for a long time and it sucks. People want to blame capitalism or socialism or whatever, but it all boils down to people. People are fucked and the most savage animals on the planet, because they have the ability to come off as genuine and can fake being your friend, or entire careers and/or relationships and then eat your heart out while you're sleeping.
neutral	Not gonna lie, for like the last 3 years, depression was kicking my ass. I was out of shape and miserable all the time. I was stuck in a downward spiral of self pity and loathing and it only made my condition worse. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Something clicked  a couple months ago. I think i realized what i was doing- i had pushed away so many loving individuals while gaining weight and playing too many videogames. I figured that the only person who could help me get out of this loop was myself. I decided i would eat better, go to the gym, and reconnect with those i pushed away. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Back to the pull up- with the help of some buddies i started exercising regularly. When i started, i absolutely hated it. But i kept going to the gym every day, and got stronger and stronger which led to today, i was finally able to do 2 full range of motion pull ups without any kind of resistance band or kip up! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Im really proud of myself for this. Im still a chubby dude (5 foot 8 in, 165 lbs), but its so cool to see myself improve. Just a couple months ago, i was a fat stereotypical asian gamer lookin dude. But a couple days ago, i got complimented on my new (albeit chunky) muscle definition, and goddamn it feels good! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Its not like ive eliminated all my flaws. I still stress eat and sleep too little. I still occasionally try too hard to be the funniest person in the room, and project myself onto others. But its baby steps, ya feel? Slowly but surely, im improving myself! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Its just a fucking pull up but it really means so much more to me. It really feels like ive succeeded at something for the first time in forever. Its the first step towards feeling happy, and normal. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sorry if this is braggadocious, im just really proud of how far ive come! :) [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] P.S. if anyone has any tips on eating clean then please help me out! Anything is appreciated :)
neutral	But sometimes it still amazes me.... Baffles me. Astounds me. We were such a powerful match. It's still incredible to me that it could have been so superficial. Because it wasn't to me. To me we were everything. To me I saw no reason to ever want for more.... I only wanted to become better for you, for me, for them, and for us. But when I did you turned your head away from me, never to return your gaze again.... One day I finally felt more alone than I ever had in my life. But what could I do? I loved you. You no longer loved me. I didn't need you anymore, so you no longer felt worth. That was so untrue. All I had ever wanted was to be be someone of lasting worth to you. In my quest to become a better spouse to you, I took away your power. I never meant to hurt you, but you couldn't find your place after I didn't need you to clean up my messes anymore. I can wish you had been different til the day I die, and it won't ever change the disappointment of my lifetime. You were supposed to be different. You were supposed to be my best friend. You were supposed to care. You were supposed to support me. Instead, after you reached out your hand to help lift me to safety, you immediately began searching for ways to discreetly push me right back off that ledge.    [linebreak]    [linebreak] If I have ever made a promise that I intend to keep, it is this:    [linebreak]    [linebreak] You will never keep me down. I will not let you change my faith in others. I will find a better man one day, one that really *is* who you only pretended to be. I won't stop till I find him, and if I never do, I will be happy anyway, everyday until the day I die. I will stay the strong amazing woman that I found inside of me, when I was with you, despite your every effort to tear me down. I am *better* than you, and I always will be.

neutral	I think this is why sites like 4chan thrive because they can't really be censored like all the mainstream ones. Then the media can basically label any user that uses those sites or any information from those sites as 'conspiracy theories' so the dumb people who don't ever actually research anything think any news from these sites are fake.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] When in reality their MSM sources are fake and 4chan has the topics that MSM wouldn't ever cover.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] Not saying everything on 4chan and related sites is reliable and that there isn't fake news on there but outside the main media sites these are the only places to get the full story.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] The way it seems to work is the MSM labels any other sources as fake so they can push fake news and the people that only use MSM don't know any better and believe any fake news they hear from MSM and disregard anything else.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] I've noticed this mainly with trump and non trump supporters since 2016. For example, CNN is basically to the point where they don't even try to hide the fake news anymore. They put out tons of fake shit daily and it will get called out on the non-popular news blogs but any anti-trump supporter will ALWAYS believe CNN and nothing else. Then in their mind they never realize that what they support does all the same shit as Trump but they just never talk about it so they never know they are supporting corrupt people.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] From what I've seen Trump supporters will actually call out fake pro-trump news all the time. They will call you out in /r/the_donald for it. All the anti-trump supporters have been brainwashed that /r/the_donald is all white supremacists at this point thanks to the 'alt-right' hoax that MSM pushes. Most of them are convinced all trump supporters are white supremacists at this point, it blows my mind. When in reality they are the racist, facist and violent ones most of the time. It doesn't matter if Trump cured cancer, they would find some type of excuse to continue hating him.
neutral	That and, if reddit's community didn't use the downvote button as a disagree button, I wouldn't be writing this post. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I do not like the current fad of releasing remakes and remasters of everything, especially in Nintendo consoles. Additionally, I am not a fan of Nintendo's practices of charging double the price for ports than you see on other consoles (Skyrim costs twice as much on the Switch than on the PS4/XBOX, the new Final Fantasy ports are apparently all at least 40€). [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am certainly not the only person who thinks this, because it is not the first time I see threads and comments being showered with replies that can be summed up to 'shut up and accept it' and flurries of downvotes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of us do not need to relive our childhood, teenagehood or whatever with constant remakes or remasters. Some of us would like new original content or sequels. But since most people keep buying these, companies have realized they can have more profit with half the work by remaking, remastering and re-releasing these games with special edition instead of focusing on other, different projects. This is what gives us stuff like Pokémon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am not trying to attack eventual posters that identify with this mindset I am disagreeing with. There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (Pokémon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much. And that is what some of us want to voice their disapproval over, but can't because the downvote brigade rains down on dissent. I had to unsubcribe from r/nintendoswitch because of this, the hivemind is just plain insufferable.
neutral	Today wasn't terrible.  I suppose that would hinge on your definition of terrible.  At any rate, I happened upon an article.  Ronda Rousey is helping set up a suicide prevention center or something.  Something like that.  As I read through the article, I came to learn that her father and grandfather committed suicide. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I appreciate the kind thought and I don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How stupid do you think I am?  Do you think I don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is?  Do you think that I'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'? [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, I don't take too kindly to being told that I don't have the right to commit suicide.  I don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when I am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why is it that when I get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is "Get help."?  What do you think this help is going to give me that I haven't already experienced?  It'll give me more goddamn bills and I'll get somebody on the phone asking me if I want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I know how to fight this.  The reason that I'm sitting here typing this is all the proof I need. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I see these anti-suicide things, I just feel so irked.  The only time you give a fuck about me is when I'm in a suicidal mindset.  Beside that, I'm just a blank face.  A mere statistic. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Believe me.  Seriously.  Believe me.  I'm not yanking your chain.  I know how bad suicide is.  You don't need to remind me of that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't stop you from trying to prevent suicide, but I can state my opinion and so, I have. [linebreak]  [linebreak]
neutral	I think you need to think about your audience when you're making those comments, instead of taking it personally.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] In a subreddit about anxiety, maybe they are too anxious to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting with anxiety and don't want to type out a long response to you. Maybe they read your post, appreciated it, and then the thought of getting help overwhelmed them. Maybe they never saw it at all because they panicked and logged out after posting.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In a subreddit about depression, maybe they are too depressed to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting depression. Maybe they appreciated your post, but can't gather the energy/motivation to type a response to it. Maybe they feel they've already wasted enough of your time.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In a confession subreddit (or one like this one), people aren't necessarily posting for your input. Maybe they just need to write it down and get it out there. Sometimes a person doesn't want advice in that case, so replying saying "thanks for the advice!" feels fake. Maybe they completely disagree with everything you've said and don't want to be petty and be like "Thanks but nothing you said is right and you're not helping at all". Or, maybe they read and appreciate the advice, but they don't think thanking everyone who gives unsolicited advice is a good idea.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of those are subreddit-specific reasons, but there's also reasons like... maybe they got a lot of responses and don't want to reply 20 times saying "Thanks!". Maybe your comment is identical to 5 other people and they've already explained/answered your questions elsewhere and don't want to do it again. Maybe they intend to reply, but get interrupted and forget. Maybe they don't see replying to random reddit people as a priority.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In short, it's probably not personal. Just relax. No one is an asshole just because they don't thank you for your advice. Your advice should be like a gift - they don't owe you anything in return, and if they do, it's not really a gift.

neutral	The thing about aces is that they're fighting erasure. Like the existence of true aces, with literally no libido and no sexual attraction of any kind to anyone, is pretty much not even acknowledged in most cases. It's brushed off as low libido, closeted homosexuality, or a lifestyle choice rather than an actual difference in brain chemistry. You actually did just that in your comment. The difference between an ace and choosing celibacy is that you don't choose to be ace, you just are. It's not deciding your sexuality is nothing, it's that your sexuality really is nothing. There's a pretty big difference between choosing celibacy because you think it's moral, desire be damned, and choosing celibacy because you flat-out lack those sexual desires. Your argument has a lot of the same points as people used to say about gay people "choosing" to be gay. Most of us are so steeped in hormones making us want to fuck that we literally cannot imagine not wanting sex at all ever, and being surrounded by the expectation that they're like that even after saying they're ace makes some aces wind up feeling like aliens on a foreign planet. You never realize how much of our society relates to sex in one form or another until you see it through an ace.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If not all of this is true for all aces, I apologise. I learned everything I know about this from a very close friend who's ace and aro, and I'm trying to condense years of talking with her about it into one comment.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Tl;dr Aces are generally ignored and/or invalidated at every turn even by other people with sexualities in the same boat, it's justified by basically saying "But it's not a sexuality to not want sex so they should be excluded," and that's a shitty, nitpicky attitude. Sexuality is just the name for your answer to "What are you sexually attracted to?" and "nothing" is an answer other than "the opposite sex," so aces should be included. They are by definition not heterosexual.

Someone will inevitably create a "meme" with some about shooting furries, because of course they will, and every time the circlejerk is reinforced and validated in the post's comments. I can't think of any other time where mods have to remove as many *(highly upvoted!)* comments as they do when furries are mentioned. Reddit loves to hate hate hate, but a lot of of them aren't brave enough to hate on actual minorities. They risk a slight chance of backlash. So instead they choose the next best thing, an easier alternative that won't *(can't)* fight back. All the feelings of superiority of hating gays or brown people, but with none of the guilt or backlash! **Bonus**: most furries are bi and gay, le epic win xD! [linebreak]  [linebreak] "It's all ironic bro! It's just jokes!" Reddit's classic excuse to get away with saying anything. "Edgy jokes" is their only excuse. Yes, the tens of thousands of highly-upvoted comments across reddit calling for shootings, gassings, dehumanization and actual threats? All just a prank bro. Something is going to happen one day (well, happen *again*, remember a gassing already did) when another person is radicalized, probably a shooting, and they're going to deny any responsibility whatsoever. And then reddit will go back to business as usual, repeat ad infinitum.
neutral	Well I identified that way from about age 14-16. I never would have if I hadn't been on tumblr. I'm designated female at birth, and I never liked being a girl, mainly because of the way our society and past societies have treated women. Also, I was always a bit of a "Tom boy." So I thought the label "genderfluid" fit what I was going through. Some days, I would feel masculine, and some days I would feel feminine and want to be perceived as such. I now realize those feelings were probably a result of me going through puberty.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Side note: I also identified as asexual when I was 14. I think this is really messed up, as most 14-year-olds are too young to think about sex, yet being on tumblr and seeing that culture told me it was ok to identify that way and I wasn't too young to know I was asexual. It turns out I was just a lesbian with repressed feelings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Originally I decided to stop identifying as genderfluid because I started dating and I didn't feel like I could adequately explain it on a dating website (yes really), so I thought "if I'm not serious enough about this to explain it to someone I might date in the future, what's the point," so now I just identify as female.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is now why I am so against tumblr identity politics. It's really messed up to see these kids go through what I had to go through because they were impressionable and misinformed. I've seen plenty of people who used to identify as "demiromantic lithrosexual bigender" when it turned out they were just gay or trans or even bisexual but they were young and wanted labels and didn't quite understand what they were going through. Tumblr encourages this and shames people who disagree even though it's toxic and can set people who actually want to find an identity back a good 2 years.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] TLDR labels bad tumblr bad puberty and repressed lesbian feelings

YouTube confirmed that, contrary to press reports, it hasn't seen any evidence of videos showing or promoting the "Momo challenge" on its platform.

Additionally, there have been zero corroborated reports of any child ever taking his or her own life after participating in this phony challenge. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of these challenges and trends follow the same formula: A local news station runs a piece overstating a dangerous teen trend. Concerned parents flock to social media to spread the word. Actual teenagers and anyone else who lives their life Extremely Online mock them for their naïveté. Brands and influencers hop on the trend, parodying it and exploiting it for their own gain. And trolls take advantage of those who believe it's real, often by creating and posting content that seemingly confirms parents' worst fears. SNL brilliantly parodied this cycle in 2010. Since then, it has only gotten worse. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Worried parents share these hoax stories relentlessly on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

neutral	In light of recent events, I present you with an analogy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You're at a party in an anonymous metropolitan city. Your friend/romantic partner/family member dragged from whatever the fuck you're doing. Now you're more pissed than a Polygon reader. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So at the party, which is, let's say 25% LGBTQIA (bare with me here) but are otherwise friendly like on TV. Then a idea popped on your head. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's about the 80s song "It's Raining Men."  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You asked the people about the song. The usual suspects would tell you it's a iconic anthem in the queer community. If you play it in public, someone's coming out the next day. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You tell them you hate it. You remember hating that song since childhood. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So you had the bright idea to change what they think about it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You tell them, "The song is about semen coming out" to much to their shock and horror. You tell them to look closer to the lyrics. Reinterpret the lyrics to fit story you want them to see. You tell them that the song came at height of the AIDS epidemic and that in some nebulous way, is detrimental to the gay community. I tell them the song is everything negative that happened to them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Cue the angry stares and every urban dictionary insult thrown your way. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That doesn't matter. What does comes after. Over time, a small minority of them will somehow agree with me. Soon they tell people about it those close to them and them to others.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Soon, it would spread to the internet. I don't need to tell what happens next. Celebrities denounce, radio station remove. The whole rigmarole.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] This isn't new. You probably know this. Hell, the whole subreddit knows (amongst others) for all I know. Hitler knew, Stalin knew, Ceaser knew. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That's how online journalism works.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] How's that for a TED talk?
neutral	I think I really needed to vent this out and forgive me for it being so long. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In late January, my dad had a massive heart attack and almost died before his 50th birthday. He had 3 clogged arteries, 100%, 85% and another 70 ish %. My heart was so fucking crushed when I saw him the ICU, all pale, IVs sticking out every which way, and a giant feeding tube shoved down his throat. That week, was probably the worst week in my entire life.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All in the months of May and June; my childhood dog died at 13, right before her birthday in July. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had to re-home my lizard because I am moving and she means literally so much to me. I fucking bawled even thinking about her leaving my home. Luckily she went to a good family friend, but it's like parting from my child for me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I got into a big fight with my old best friend and they said some really cruel and nasty things about me and I honestly don't know when that wound will heal for me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My therapist from since I was 2 years old, has cancer. It rapidly approached and in just a month she went from active and clear headed, to being at the point where she can no longer take care of herself and needs daily assistance. [linebreak]  [linebreak] During this entire year, I think I've been abusing a substance, using it as a crutch. I want to get help, but I also don't want to necessarily stop altogether. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So basically that was my year (so far). I have to admit, there have been some really wonderful things that have happened, but it's hard to enjoy them. I mean, this year will always be branded into my brain (The most being my father's near death experience). [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thank you for reading and I hope you can have a wonderful rest of 2019
neutral	I got shit reflexes and coordination aswell, but you can get past it. Here, let me give you some advice: [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 1 - Just roll into Boss attacks mostly, their attacks are really telegraphed so even with garbage reaction times you should still see em coming. For most common hollows, don't lock on, run past them, pivot and backstab (their tracking is really shitty so you can dance circles around their attacks). You can also run straight to the boss rooms since you get iframes on going through fog walls. Learn your parry timings, especially on Black Knights and Gwyn, the greatsword ones are the easiest due to how telegraphed their attacks are. Don't wear heavy armor and always fast roll unless you got that sweet 76 poise and a high stability greatshield. Oh, and always kill the dogs first. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 2 - The PVE in this game is cancer, but you should be in this game for the PVP. The tracking is insane so backstabbing enemies is not a cakewalk. There are no iframes on fog walls so getting into boss rooms is even more of a task but the great thing is, the bosses in this game are super easy - they're mainly just variants of armored knights. My advice is, increase your adaptability so you can get atleast 99 / 100 agility for those extra roll / backstep iframes. Upgrade your weapons as soon as possible and keep your equip load under 50. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 3? It's pretty much just DS1 but with a some Bloodborne style faster paced action in it. You can still easily backstab enemies but parrying is somewhat less instant which makes it harder. The game also hands out rolls like free candy, meaning you can spam it and become a lot harder to hit. Like the first game, KILL THE DOGS FIRST. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'll add more to this later.
neutral	Hey! [linebreak] First thing I want to say: [linebreak] It's okay to not be someone's best friend. I've never had a best friend. I've always been friends with different types of people and it sounds like you have too. [linebreak] There's the people I want to go out with, there's the people that make me laugh so hard I throw up (truestory), there's the people I go to when I feel like shit or need advice, the people I can have really deep conversations with, etc.! [linebreak] Ofcourse some of these overlap, but in the end you have friends because they fill a certain role in your life, and I think that's beautiful. Sometimes you want to hang with the one person, and sometimes you don't, and that's okay :)  [linebreak] To me, it would be the worst to have one person you depend on the most. But that's pesonal. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The second point I want to make is that this could be an important moment in your life: the friends you have now, you won't want to have for the rest of your life either. You'll move away from each other, grow apart, or take a different path in life, and that's all okay! Maybe you and your current best friend will grow apart. But you'll find new friends, in the weirdest places, that you have the best connections with. It's okay to lose people, in a while you'll be happy for them that they've found their way in life.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And if you really want to be someone's best friend, someone with whom you share everything, someone that you trust completely, that won't ever backstab you: you will. If it's not right now, it's yet to come :) it has nothing to do with who you are, everyone is weird and you'll find the right level of weirdness to match yours. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Surround yourself with the people you enjoy spending time with, you don't need any labels for that.
neutral	I don't know how this subreddit works but I need to get something off my chest haha [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've been recovered from bulimia for like a year and partially recovered for 2. I've been eating whatever I want because if I try and restrict what I eat, it just sends me down a really unhealthy guilty path that I'm not in the place to go down anymore.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The problem is I've gotten fat. My BMI is technically healthy (23) but we all know it doesn't mean anything. I'm in the middle of some serious exams and I can't excersize right now because I need to study all the time. All I can feel is my legs touching and my stomach rolling on itself and my flabby arms and the extra skin on my back and the flab on my waist and my fat neck. I don't know how much of this is dysmorphia and how much is me being fat, but I'm fine most of the time until it hits me in waves like it is now.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I tried to take some nudes and my body just seemed wrong. I tried to put on a pair of shorts but they've gotten so tight they barely fit. I bought all my clothes when I was BMI 16.5-19 and they're so tight and ill-fitting now, and I can't afford more. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I really just wish I could take a scissors and chop off all the fat. It's so unfair, because whenever I see someone who has told me they recovered from an eating disorder, they look normal. They haven't gained loads of weight like me. I just want to go on a diet, but I promised myself I'd eat whatever I want until the end of this year, to let myself get used to this new body. If I start dieting I'm scared I'll just hate myself more. I'm so annoyed I just wish I didn't feel like this.
neutral	I know this is two days old, but I'll give it a shot. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It comes from selective understanding. Both of those points aren't necessarily contradictory depending on just how you're viewing them and how you're making those points. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The idea of Piracy not being a lost sale comes from the idea that a number of people who pirate games would not buy it in the first place, and would only play it if they can pirate it. Think teenagers without their own spending money, or people trying out a game because they *can* without paying, but wouldn't bother trying it if they had to pay for it. The idea of it potentially helping comes from these same people enjoying the game and recommending it to other people, who in turn actually pay for the game. Along with some of the people who pirate it enjoying it to the point where they want to support the devs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Where this comes to potentially hurting the developers, well, the important phrase in the last paragraph is "a number of people". As we can see from these threads, the people who wouldn't buy it anyway aren't all of the people who pirate. They may not even be a large portion at all. For example, the people in this thread saying or implying they'll pirate it would otherwise buy the game if it was on Steam. They're doing it to stick it to the man in their eyes, because they *are* lost sales. And they're using the fact they don't want to support the Epic Games Store as a moral excuse.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Essentially, they are valid points, assuming the "lost sale" defense is based in reality which I can't comment on. But a lot of these people just want any moral excuse to pirate games and will use whatever feels the most convenient. Instead of just pirating and accepting it's wrong to do, but they don't care.
neutral	Steemit is promising but also a ghost town now. Functionality wise it's pretty cool though, like Reddit but more like a blog site, so you can have pictures and video in your post (think instead of image and self post it's the two combined kind of like a html document). [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's run on a cryptocurrency where the upvotes and karma actually add up to a payout. Naturally it is now 99% bot abuse and karma farming and the shittest shitposts you've ever seen, 1% actual users posting legitimately cool art stuff and of course circlejerking over this week's popular shitcoin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The big draw of it, that is both also a huge disadvantage, is that no one can physically delete anything. It can be downvoted ("flagged") into oblivion and the frontend can be set up to expunge stuff below a score though, and there is no one there to intervene when someone does that. So that makes for a kind of shit culture where people are scared to upset the power users who can drop a -10 dollar flag on your post, or make a bot that auto flags everything. The idea of it is though that it's a monetisation model where the act of voting does a blockchain thing that makes more of that coin, and you get money from it (and the voter gets some as well called curation). In theory yeah that's great, in practice you need literally millions of upvotes from small steem power accounts to amount to anything, and there is nothing stopping some bully from running an account that does nothing but auto flag all submissions by someone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But as far as hosting something up there goes it works super well at least lol. And if it were actually populated with a broad userbase it would counteract the problems I mentioned above. To some extent, because you can never really stop someone with power from abusing it.
neutral	Eh, I think there's a slightly different factor to this case. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As has been pointed out many times over the past few years - it's pretty strange that 'the highest grossing film of all time by far' is a one-off oddity from 2009 whose story and characters had almost no cultural impact. People struggle to remember the names of almost any character in the film, there are no memorable quotes from it in the pop cultural lexicon, no scenes or plot concepts getting referenced or homaged, nobody walking around in Avatar t-shirts, etc. Compare it to Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Marvel, E.T., Jaws, Titanic, Batman, Frozen, or any other cultural and financial *phenomenon*, and its content is a total obscurity. Even Shrek and Pirates Of The Carribean had a way bigger pop culture impact, for their first couple films anyway. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Point being, it's rubbed a lot of people the wrong way that the highest grossing movie in the entire 100-year history of the medium has, for a decade now, been one that's significant almost entirely for a camera gimmick. Even other films like The Wizard Of Oz, Star Wars and Jurassic Park which are similarly famous for their gamechanging technological breakthroughs *also* had iconic stories, characters and dialogue which have long outlasted the novelty of their SFX. [linebreak]  [linebreak] An Avengers film *finally* topping Avatar at the box office feels more like a victory for common sense than brand loyalty, because the *content* of the Marvelverse has had all the ubiquitous cultural impact that Avatar lacked, and it's nice to know that more human beings have connected with something like that, than just been roped into going to the theater for some 3D hype alone.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A world where Avengers, not Avatar, is society's highest grossing movie of all time is a world that makes a little more sense to everybody, in a time in desperate need of that.
neutral	Don't know if your still searching the job market but: [linebreak]  [linebreak] I was kind of in a similar situation to yours. Got rejected from a 3D art school, and they pretty much took anyone so I felt like shit. At that point I had also been looking for employment for more than a year and i just kept getting rejected/no answer. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I eventually decided to not pursue college as it seemed unnecessary to my career plans, and rather fully focus on personal projects and also work on other people's animated short films (Artella.com). This was a huge help, (but definitely took a while), it got me stuff to put on my reel that looked like feature animation basically. At this point I was constantly sending my work to people in the industry, and getting feedback, redoing, getting more feedback, etc etc.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Getting the job felt like luck, which sucks to say, I really did just apply at the right time, when they really needed people (tends to be late spring/summer for most VFX houses). Someones going to have to take a risk on you, and they wont do that until you know, your confident that your reel is up to standards with modern day animation/VFX. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You tend to see a lot of negative connotations around the industry, and people telling you to get out while you can. I was fully aware of that when I was feeling unmotivated after lots of rejections. But I wouldn't let it get to ya, try the industry for yourself before taking someone else's word for it. Sure there are people that grow out it, but I've seen people that genuinely still love what they're doing even after many many years. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Keep improving, keep applying, and approach recruiters on LinkedIn informally, have chats with them about future opportunities. They're a lot more friendly than most people realize ;)  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Best of luck.
neutral	>I think the fact that we had a civil war, and 50% of american voters voted in an open white nationalist, and (insert all the structural racism in the USA, wealth inequality, countless instances of direct racial bias and bigotry, etc), the idea that a confederate american state could rise and participate in global affairs isn't far fetched for an alternate history game that wants real ideological / economic threads to inform the events in the game. [linebreak] the problematic part is not the inclusion of a revived, politically significant, openly racist and fascist (sorry to anyone who don't know this, but the rise of so-called "populism" you see on the right is a rise of fascism, read a book) confederacy in WW2, but rather the prospect of individual players identifying with the confederacy and what such play indicates and consists in. is it okay to role play as lynching thugs? [linebreak] it's a deep question, honestly. contextualized properly, one can do interesting things with it. other art forms employ genuine antiheroes (like tony soprano, who is, simply, a psychopath) and do good things (criticize capitalism, and the emotional/intellectual dissociation involved with immoral behavior both localized and structural/systemic). what does "I'M the character" do to change it? in a book, we're often in the person's mind. their thoughts replace ours in a focused narrative. is that alright? will i become a psychopath if i read such media? [linebreak] i don't know. i think it merits discussion, but the statement the guy made sounds fine to me. are they cashing in on the rise of the alt-right and open white supremacy in america? i don't know. do we want to allow role playing games and alternate reality media? that one, i'm pretty comfortable with yes. we need to do deeper, broader, better things to eliminate white supremacists than make sure they can't role play as the confederacy joining WW2. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This mad about a video game
neutral	i wasn't doxxed, but i don't enjoy reddit as much as i used to. it feels like an addiction or a distraction at the moment and it's surprisingly sad how often i am noticing myself think "oh you should take a picture of this and share it" or "that's a funny story you should post this", i don't seem to enjoy doing things for the sake of it any more and rather it's me trying to get reactions out of people, whether that's disgust or laughter. last month i challenged myself to take a week off reddit because i noticed i was on it too much, i lasted 2 days and then started coming back on now, so recently i just thought fuck it i need to be able to go more than 2 days without going on here, that's not healthy. i was going to write something more in depth but i really just need to stop coming on here for a while, i said a month to myself so i'll go for that. the more time i spend on reddit, the less time i spend doing other things and it's not worth it for me. i see people spending so much time on social media and said i never wanted to be like them but i have become like that. so ill probably make a blog/video/something in a few weeks just to talk about it properly because i think a lot of people will be in similar positions and won't be aware of it or willing to try and change. [linebreak]  [linebreak] there's a lot on my mind at the moment so i just need to step back and think about what i should do now. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Snapshots: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1.

neutral	From the link [linebreak]  [linebreak] For a detailed discussion of the statistical mistakes that almost all climate scientists have been making, see my critique of the statistical analyses in the IPCC's 2013 Assessment Report. The critique concluded that the statistical analyses are seriously incompetent, and further, that no one has yet drawn valid inferences, via statistics, from climatic time series. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My critique was submitted to the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, by Lord Donoughue. Lord Donoughue also arranged for a meeting at the Department: with the Department's Under Secretary of State and the Department's Chief Scientific Adviser, among others. The meeting was held on 9 January 2014. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At the meeting, the Chief Scientific Adviser claimed that there was observational evidence for significant global warming. I claimed that there was no such evidence—as per my critique. The Chief Scientific Adviser maintained his claim, but was unable to present any such evidence at the meeting. He said, though, that he would later send details of such evidence to Lord Donoughue. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Details of such evidence, however, were never sent. Thus, the Department seemed to effectively acknowledge that my claim was correct: observational evidence does not exist. Furthermore, twelve days after the meeting, on 21 January 2014, the Under Secretary made a statement in Parliament on behalf of the UK government. The statement was as follows. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Her Majesty's Government does not rely upon any specific statistical model for the statistical analysis of global temperature time series. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Global temperatures, along with many other aspects of the climate system, are analysed using physically-based mathematical models, rather than purely statistical models.  [HL4497] [linebreak]  [linebreak] In plain English, the UK government stopped using or relying on statistical analysis of observational evidence for global warming; instead, the government started relying solely on computer simulations of the climate system. In short, the government effectively accepted the main conclusions of my critique.
neutral	So I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/b28vlq/admins_have_wrongfully_suspended_my_4th_account/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) [linebreak] about my account being suspended after I called out the admins in r/modsupport the other day. I then had another account suspended the very next day, brand new account for the same trumped up "ban evasion" bs, I've submitted appeals on every account and emailed as well as contacting the r/modsupport mod mail.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, one of the subs I used to moderate was r/snp which is the subreddit of the Scottish national party, of which I am a member. This is the current party in power in the Scottish parliament whose ultimate goal is Scottish independence. I've come to learn that u/dougal83 is actually a mod and supporter of r/UKIPparty. This would be like someone modding r/the_donald and r/the_mueller, or r/liberalism and r/conservative.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I messaged the modmail to get re added and was told that Dougal has no intention of re adding me unless a Reddit "moderator" (admin) messages them telling them it was in error. Now everyone knows Reddit admins A) don't discuss actions taken on other users accounts, and B) would never do that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] After calling out the inaccuracy of that statement, I was [muted](https://imgur.com/a/GfgSgmz) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now this is a small subreddit so not being able to mod it isn't the end of the world as I attend my local branch's meetings consistently and pay dues. But it's a bit rich that people are playing both sides. Note when I was first added as a moderator back in october, I simply messaged the mod mail and was added with no questions asked or even a response to the mod mail. Just a simple invitation.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: conveniently, my cyberstalker commented on this post, lacking any awareness of his surroundings lol, mods please leave the comment up so people can see what I been dealing with first hand. This is a brand new account mind you.
neutral	You're an idiot. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >...downvoted just because people don't agree. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yes, that's correct. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why do you think that is? You think you get upvotes because of respect? Because you're right?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The voting system is purely democratic. And it changes with the audience. If you put this comment on twitter directly under another person who was upset with Beiber, then you'd likely get heaps of likes. Unfortunately, they're useless and nobody should really care about them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >...you have to find every single joke on the planet absolutely hilarious... [linebreak]  [linebreak] Who said that? Quote me one person in this thread or in the entirety of this comment section who said something along those lines. I seriously want to know. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't know anyone who says that. It's basically impossible to find most jokes funny. Not everyone can appreciate light humour like Piano Cat while still enjoying Holocaust jokes. But hey, if you can, then you're probably insane. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That being said, if you really hate certain jokes that much, ignore them. Anyone who tells speeches or does stand-up knows that the worst feeling you could have after saying something is not a unanimous reaction or a food execution, but just complete silence as everyone transitions to whatever else they were doing.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >I feel like the people who get bent out of shape when someone doesn't agree with them are the ones who are way too sensitive... [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yes. Again, yes. No one disagrees with you there, especially the aforementioned maniac. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I would go as far as saying most people who get bent out of shape are very sensitive, almost as if that's a defining trait of sensitive people, discounting those that are too shy to voice their opinion, of course. [linebreak]  [linebreak] edit: spelling [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR fuck you read what I said
neutral	Man, that's a far more considered and thoughtful response than my barely-coherent madman's rant merited, if you were to ask me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Strictly speaking, my issue isn't with technology - technology is a dumb object, but humanity is a dumber object and has only managed to hurt itself with the power tools. The shed remains unbuilt. My issue is with civilisation, and largely rests on my belief that civilisation has failed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's like if you were simulating a financial market, but when you click "run simulation", instead of running the simulation, the machine wipes your entire dataset, hard faults, and power cycles. Human civilisation has completely failed to attain any of the meaningful goals set out for it. It's a large-scale tribalist shitshow led around by marketeers because we, as a species, don't understand how to leave other tribes alone and let them be as they want to be, and we're far too eager to jump onboard anything that lets us feel smug about it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Note that, while I advocate for the destruction of computers, I say nothing about the machinegun or high explosives.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] My position, as it is, lies somewhere between the most far-right of right-wings (constitutional imperialism when?!) and extremist accelerationism. I want to see all the groups, all the tribes, big and small, arm themselves to the teeth and then go at it hammer and tongs. There are lessons that humanity needs to learn, and they're not going to learn them out of a fucking book. They're also not going to learn them without incurring a few bruises, and the sooner they make peace with that particular fact the better. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The thing that stops us all getting what we want, is our insistence that everyone else get what *we* want as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] More fundamentally: *We cannot, ourselves, create change in others*.
neutral	I think you're incorrect on basically all counts here.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >The only thing Trump has had to deal with that others haven't is an incredibly hostile media ... and Mueller [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd point you to the inordinate and record number of federal injunctions imposed by activist judges as evidence that this isn't the case, but my point here isn't simply that life is hard for Trump [linebreak]  [linebreak] >What do you think is going to happen? Do you think the 1-3% of the actual American populace represented by r/politics and places on Reddit like it are going to cause some kind of massive uprising or civil war? [linebreak]  [linebreak] No, I think the roughly half of Americans that are more sympathetic to the ideology that r/politics professes are going to be continuously influenced by an incredibly vocal minority (something which is pretty evidently happening) and that it's going to manifest itself in the mainstream in things like popular democratic presidential candidates advocating for an unconstitutional wealth tax and increasing the IRS's enforcement budget. If you don't think Warren is popular enough to be worried about, then Kamala Harris hand waving away your private insurance should be equally concerning even if it doesn't appear obviously as totalitarian.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Assume that Republicans win in a landslide in 2020, do you think the marxist ideas that have surfaced and been pushed to the forefront disappear entirely? They certainly haven't thus far in history. Does the increasingly partisan divide in our politics that can be demonstrated empirically cease to exist?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If the only thing you're worried about is an out and out civil war and not your individual liberty and property being legislated away from you then you need to reconnect to politics. I get that my original comment doesn't really allude to these concerns but they're all interconnected as I see it.
neutral	Here's where I think the distinction lies - I may be wrong, and call me out if you want, but here goes: [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, believe all victims is a good and noble idea at a basic level.  When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play.  When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim.  The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it:  His claims had a major effect to divide the country.  Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story.  When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.
neutral	When I was in the fourth grade my mom homeschooled me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or, in reality, she enslaved me and my siblings. My sister was her eldest, her precious artist, and my brother was her little angel, her precious baby and only boy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] She had two hands for two kids and I didn't fit in. She constantly put me down and physically beat me. Once hitting me in the head with a frying pan because I didnt do the dishes right. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I got away from her finally, and for my graduation project i decided to do something based around child abuse [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Because of that emotional abuse that i went through, i thought less of my self and had a thin skin, always crying. And everyone called me sensitive, a crybaby, the little piggy who cried all the way home.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] But I'm here to tell you that you're not alone. There are thousands of surveys and information online, and I think you need to start educating others because you're not sensitive, you're hurt and you need help, like I needed help. It can be different for you but you need people who support you. It hurts to think people are so cruel, but I was at the brunt end of it for a while, so I want you to know I'm here for you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Message me at any time, ask me questions, vent or rant to me. Because, no, I may not have gone through the exact same thing, but I went through something close. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I hope you consider talking to me. It's always better to start off ranting online when you can hide behind a screen and let your emotions take over. I want your emotions to be valid, because everyone deserves to feel validated.
neutral	While it is going away, I find people still appreciate it. Some old aunt might act offended if you don't send her a thank you card. Forget her. If you are sending a card because it is expected of you, then you are sending it for the wrong reason anyway.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] On the other hand. When someone gives you a gift and you say thank you in person, you now have the opportunity to double down on a good thing.  Almost all mail you get is trash these days, so it's nice when something isn't. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Hi, Grandma,   [linebreak] >   [linebreak] >It was great seeing you at the baby shower last week. With the baby on the way I know my life is about to get much more hectic and it was so nice to get to see you before I loose any chance at sleep, hahaha. Thank  you so much for the crib I was afraid I would have to keep the baby in a shoe box but this will be so much better. I can't wait until the next time I see you and I hope all is well.   [linebreak] >   [linebreak] >Love,   [linebreak] >   [linebreak] >Batman [linebreak]  [linebreak] It takes very little time to write one of these and the person who receives it will likely appreciate hearing from you, especially if they are older.  You don't even need to go all out on special cards from hallmark or some shit. regular paper is no less sentimental, which is the whole point.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm certainly not saying you should do it. But you might consider looking at it as something you can do that someone who gave you a gift will enjoy, instead of something you \*have\* to do because your parents or whoever said so.
neutral	. I just watched a 4 hour long disclosure buffet my greer. I honestly have no reason I would doubt him. He had extensive knowledge. His history and accounts are all verifiable. He has incredibly powerful and high up people informing or working with him. This video I'm pretty sure was ten years old have no idea what he's up to these days. I am impressed he just comes out and tells you what he knows and I'm sure the only reason he's Alive is because no one could even make this stuff up. If everything he says is true I don't know how he copes with a reality like that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Although Tom DeLonge has some impressive sounding people in his "accadedemy" they are a few very smart people with nice sounding titles Lou Elizando who I admire for wanting to disclose, was only running a program that was disinfo at best. Head of aerospace threat identification program sounds for the Pentagon sounds super impressive but if greer is telling the truth he was a government coffee boy. I would bet my life savings Trump I would never be read into magic12 or even told anything more than what keeps him entertained. His books were very fun to read and incredibly fun. If you know about nazj Germany, vril, anartica, the post ww2 expedition, area 51, and all the publicly documented sightings in public knowledge you will learn nothing but the fictional stories about people involved in the deepest levels are a fun "look in". I think Tom wants to find out the "truth" whatever the hell that is, but is way over his head. Probably half his team are people that are in the know set to spread disinfo. It gets people thinking though but like I usually say baby steps are always good.
neutral	I agree that single-payer would be terrible.  The thing is that most universal healthcare systems are not single payer  and they aren't free  at the point of service.  I have actually handled marketing for healthcare in three other countries and can say that it can actually work rather well if it is set up prudently.  I will try to dig up the OECD data, but I found that wait times are actually not worse in multiplayer systems than the United States. However, they are considerably worse in single payer systems. More specifically, I used to  handle digital marketing for a major private health insurance company in Australia.  Over there, 50% of people have private health insurance. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, the tax system over there actually incentivizes middle-class and rich people to purchase private health insurance. The goal is to make sure that the public system is mostly being used by people that have no other alternative. This reduces the problems  that would lead to rationing  and unsustainable cost increases, as you correctly pointed out.  Plus, people that are willing to pay for a private system are going to get higher quality care, which should absolutely be their right.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  Also, the Australian government requires people to pay something like 15% of the bill every time they get a service. This is a necessary element to keep people from going to the hospital every time they have a stomachache. It helps keep costs in check and bottlenecking the system so people have to wait forever.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  Single-payer system would actually be horrible. The only country I'm aware of that has the single-payer system liberals seem to talk about is Canada. They have the worst weight times and one of the worst rated healthcare systems outside the United States.
slur	> Only a drooling retard would think criminalizing fiction is a good thing. Are you a drooling retard? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Did you read the linked story?  Like at all?  Imagine thinking that wanting that stuff made illegal makes me a "drooling retard" that wants to "criminalize fiction."  That story was the op's deviant sexual fantasy, and if someone came upon that story they'd be hard pressed to discover it's "role play" instead of seeing it for what it is, child pornography, written instead of photos or video but still reprehensible and absolutely a loophole being freely exploited. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Ask yourself this, these people get off only to the pretend aspect and not the being attracted to children and children in sexual situations aspect?
slur	Seriously. Like drama aside I'm thankful for OP posting this for that video alone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The build up to walking into the room, "I don't care, I don't give a fuck" with our protagonist swinging on a man who is still deep within genital jousting, the mess of a room with the PS4 to the side elevated on a stool leaving the viewers to ponder on a accident waiting to happen, the girl's confusion then having her seconds later playfully lift her leg on our antagonist, "You lucky I like you bro, hell nah" from fury to resignation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And who can forget the classic but reliable seasoning, young white guy using the N-word. Masterpiece in storytelling, SSS rank video.
slur	No one says this, Jesus Christ.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The original Wonder Woman series came out in the 70's, so did the Bionic Woman and people didn't bitch about it then. No one had issues with with any of the female heroes in X-Men, no one gave a fuck about Jessica Jones being female, no one complained about the new Wonder Woman movie, and so on.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I swear, these people have the memory of a goldfish, acting like every new female superhero movie was the first one to ever come out and that any criticism of it must be from "incel misogynistic virgin man-babies" and not because the movie might, actually, you know, suck.
slur	Because the kids (including the 16 y/o) don't understand what they're talking about, it was clearly orchestrated by the adults (presumably parents) who are just using their kids as tools to make the senator look bad. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Diane is trying to explain her side & they keep interrupting her, naturally she says "well you know better than I do" facetiously and suddenly people are *literally* calling her a "bitch". No, the lady who won't let a senator much older and wiser than herself speak is the bitch. Diane only resorts to saying this shit because nobody will let her talk, and it's very clear if you watched the video.

slur	[linebreak] I just saw endgame, and it was pretty good, but there were a few weird things. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I thought it was strange how the Russo Brothers decided to render Thanos' erect penis in such vivid detail. The veins were so perfectly done I couldn't even tell his cock wasn't real. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Another thing I found weird was when Black Panther broke the fourth wall and gave the audience the n-word pass. I did appreciate it, but it would feel more in place in a Deadpool movie. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Overall, it was still excellent, but I think that they definitely need to reconsider some things.
slur	There's two groups of white people who say the n-word: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. White people who grew up around *so many* black people who actually like them it became part of their vocabulary. (VERY rare. I know one. He only says it around mostly other white people when drunk and his black wife explained the first time it happened that he has a pass from her and their close friends.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] 2. White people who know no black people personally and only know black culture from rap music and think it sounds tough. This type generally quickly get in fights if/when they encounter actual black people.
slur	>I mean, people say shit in the heat of the moment sometimes when they're angry. The mind will go to the worst possible words it can think of and use those because it has the intensity of how the person feels. I doubt it's a word he uses on a regular basis, and if you've never slipped up before then I don't know what to tell you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've been playing video games for damn near my entire life, I've never ever called someone a "nigger". Like literally never. It has to already be in your vocabulary for you to slip up like that
slur	Had a similar encounter on Xbox Live. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I was playing sea of thieves when after and hour of playing a teammate dumped all of our treasure overboard and detonated some gunpowder, sinking the ship. I was all 'What are you doing?!" over voip, and then after we kicked him from the group I got a message saying: [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Hahahaha you should have heard yourself cuck. Better luck next time faggot". [linebreak]  [linebreak] I replied with: "Twat", yet I am the one who earned a 48 hour ban, and a mark on my Live account.
slur	>Saying something is retarded isn't insulting mental disabilities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Potential flair material? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've seen people who are very insecure of their masculinity, but never ones who are so insecure about their *maturity*. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reminds me of 2011 days when a guy used to shit endlessly on (of all things) Dora the Explorer in order to "prove he was a grown up", on a forum I used to visit. Everyone usually responded with "Why are you even watching it now if you aren't a toddler?" which would trigger him even more.
slur	>I mean, if you want me to seriouspost, my main chemical/biological/emotional need other than food and water is physical contact with beautiful girls and the lack of that in my life has been really torturous and destructive for me,  [linebreak] >>to solve this problem, you need to lose about 30 pounds and trim that neckbeard and get a haircut. Also maybe consider showering (like right now and regularly after that) and washing your clothes [linebreak] >>>That won't "solve" it, that just changes it into other problems. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Really nigga?
slur	There's a bar in this area that used to sell "crack fries." They were called that because they were addictive and made with cracked pepper. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A bunch of white kids from the local college called it racist, staged a bunch of protests, and got the company to change the name to "cosmic fries." [linebreak]  [linebreak] A decade earlier, another batch of white kids from that same college did the exact same thing to force a chain of coffee stores to change their name from "beaners" to "bigbys."
slur	A company I was a permanent IT contractor at went through a pretty major board and org shakeup. One of the first things the new CEO did was eliminate reserved parking spaces. Some people bitched, his response was "if you are inportant enough to need one, you'll be here early enough to get a good spot anyway".  [linebreak]  [linebreak] They also aggressively recruited some female high level management, two of whom said they would rather be chosen on merit, not diversity. (those are the women who run things).
slur	What you think happened: [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Hey bitch, let's go to a concert. When we're done you have to let me bust in your guts. You owe me" [linebreak]  [linebreak] What really happened: [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Hey, I've got tickets to a concert in a city a few hours away, want to come out on a date with me? I dont want to drive back late at night so we would have to get a hotel, is that cool with you?"
slur	Yep, one time I made a caption generator of the famous "Hitler reacts" in the Berlin bunker TV scene, bitching about a video game, and despite it having nothing to do with Hitler, and being funny af according to most who watched it, somebody complained to the guild leader and I had to remove it. Fucking ridiculous that actually mocking Hitler is unacceptable, becos Hitler, according to some morons who desire their head being buried in sand.
slur	>Don't look at what others have to make sure you have more, look to make sure they have enough. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is said by the same people that constantly bitch and moan about income and wealth inequality, instead of actual poverty. Margaret Thatcher was right when she said that leftists would rather have the poor poorer, provided the rich would be less rich. It was true back then and it is still true today.
slur	Look, buddy, totally off the record and this is in your best interest.  Trump is a f-sluring r-slur, and if you don't stop pushing his buttons he's going to get really mad at you.  Stop trying to arrange a face-to-face with the guy and let us do our f-sluring jobs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] *runs to media crying* [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's like these guys would rather score points against Daddy than get anything done!
slur	The fucking hypocrisy of some 'gamers' is real. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Buying games is about keeping the developers you love afloat and continuing the gaming hobby. [linebreak]  [linebreak] 'Pirate' games because you are a piece of shit who either does not want to buy it because you are a cheap ass then don't bitch when those companies go down under. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The same applies to Anime, Manga, Television, Movies, whatever.
slur	It's a comedy podcast infamous for being politically incorrect. The hosts are leftists, but make comedy for lumpenproletarians. People who don't know shit about not calling people tranny's or retards but who want those people to have homes and healthcare and shit.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of it is pretty funny, I liked their Austin Powers parody where he got  vaccinated and became Autism Powers and just really liked trains
slur	>Who's fuckin callin you, nigga [linebreak]  [linebreak] Honestly, the fighting a bro while he's balls deep in a girl was less stupid than how those two pasty white idiots kept calling each other "nigga." [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bro, neither of you is any kind of nigga. Maximum fucking cringe. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, that poor girl. Don't let stupid or crazy stick its dick in you, I guess.
slur	Isn't this the same kind of hatred that these people are supposed to be against?  Like they'll hound someone with a "God hates fags" poster but won't bat an eye at a man getting assaulted for being white and probably join in.  The hypocrisy is strong with these people.  But it's like MLK says Hate can't be fought with hate, only love can defeat hate.
slur	I can't speak for everyone. It's not horrible in my experience, but I don't think people tie it back to disabilities. It's just a weird for someone being hyperactive or weird. I think retard is more of our equivalent to spastic.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I think it's starting to change a bit though. It's one of those words I tried to phase out of my vocabulary.
slur	They're also bitching about not making any tips. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's easy to gain tips if you're friendly and provide good service. Being attractive also helps, but I've seen "plain-looking" guys rake in a lot of tips because they were charismatic and entertaining.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Complaining that you're not making any tips doesn't mean it's capitalism's fault... most of the time, *it's your own.*
slur	SS: Censorship in the West is ramping up. Say that the Holocaust is technically impossible? Get your mike cut. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This wasn't a user error since the Vimeo livestream didn't also cut out. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Remember when the MSM used to bitch about China's censorship? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why do Governments need censorship? What happens when those measures aren't effective?
slur	r/writingprompts is like the only sub you can legitimately believe is fanfic and stories. The rest is a mix of obvious BS and occasional truth strewn about.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anytime I see an essay length post with a ridiculously detailed back story and a paragraph explaining the abbreviations ("BM: Bitchy mom, S: Sis"...etc.) I just dismiss that as fake.
slur	Is your username a reference to that time Al Sharpton accidentally said "the nigga word" instead of "the n-word" on tv?  If so, you might be the only other person who remembers that shit.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It had to have been force of habit.  Al Sharpton looks like he says nigga all the time.  Either way it's funny.
slur	> openly, nakedly racist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Somewhere, somebody, supposedly has a tape of him using the N-word.  There is no actual public record of him saying it and he hires and promotes blacks and he even sued Palm Beach to allow country clubs to desegregate but obviously he is openly, nakedly racist because someone said so.
slur	- Please clean your room. There's an entire TIRE in there.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] - Lot of ni**a for all these white folks lmfao [linebreak]  [linebreak] - Girl just laying there like. Yeah. This is normal.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] - is it like... broad daylight out? He left him at the club at 3 in the afternoon?
slur	I know I'm a faggot but I actually like their videos.  They ride around on motorcycles with gopros and go poke shit and show the real China.  The China I could go see if ~~I didn't spend all my money drinking and buying toys~~ it wasn't so expensive to live in this city.
slur	One is reference to be called a name instead of being judged by your character, and the other is used in a post on 4chan in an anti-semitic way. So no i didn't stop listening to the song when he said 'kike me'. I just can tell the difference between the two.
slur	I'm from a city east of Atlanta and currently live in the Midwest.  I have heard more n-words here than I ever did down south.  Most people here have maybe met a handful of minorities in their entire life meanwhile down south my high school was half white and half black.
slur	We'll keep making words not politically correct, and then people will just start using a different word. [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Imbecile" was a medical term before people started using it as an insult. Then "retarded". Now "autistic". [linebreak]  [linebreak] This attitude will never go away but the words will just keep changing.
slur	I'm not sure if moist heat is any better for the garden, but half my garden is trying to die since this heat wave started.  Really the only thing I have to bitch about with the heat is kitchen work in this weather.  Ready for this damn heat wave GTFO
slur	> If a man approaches me on the street, and I've got visible headphones in, and I don't react at all, he assumes I can't hear him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Idk even still I get the "WHAT A FUCKING BITCH YOU CUNT" because I didn't grace them with my attention
slur	You just don't get it! They're laughing WITH black people when they call them the N word! Not at them! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Jeez, You'd have to be a racist neo-nazi troll to think that r/blackpeopletwitter using the N word in every instance they refer to black people as racism!
slur	r/Tinder has been getting honestly misogynistic and red-pilly lately (not that it was a paragon of feminism to begin with, mind you). I've seen comments where the girl being talked to was straight up called "a huge bitch" for not playing along on yet another terrible joke/pickup line.
slur	In the US, calling someone a spaz could be considered insulting depending on the context, but not on the level of "retard" or even "idiot" or "fool".  More along the lines of "ditz" or "dope" in that it's generally perceived as playful rather than derogatory.
slur	I will say as an American that has lived abroad for years, it does get kind of old when everyone bitches about us. I get it, a lot of the criticism is fair. But it can make me defensive, which isn't really a good response.
slur	Hey that's me, I am actually gay , and I joke that I am a ragging faggot who wants to suck every dick I see, but I should be sent off to a conversion camp. It's almost like people laugh at different things
slur	If She can't understand that bitches ain't shit but money and hos" is about a glorification of a lifestyle that one hopes to achieve though talent that will be used to enrich the community - then maybe she's not the woman for you."
slur	Sooo... Question. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not American. I thought in American culture saying the n word was a huge taboo for white people? I'm seeing these guys saying it so naturally it's kinda weird. Is it only a rule for public media or...?
slur	I mean you're the one going into a random SRD thread to passive-aggressively bitch about the fact that that you were linked here. Hell I didn't even think the energy drink thread was that great but this is next level petty shit.
slur	I've only ever heard "spaz" used as a good-natured "that kid has too much energy but in a kinda amusing way". It's often not even meant as an insult at all and I had no idea it was considered offensive anywhere.
slur	Yeah, it always surprises me when an American tells people not to use retard but then use spastic/spaz liberally. It's really shocking for me whenever I hear/read it [linebreak]  [linebreak] For the unaware, it refers to people with cerebral palsy
slur	Saw Darts post and investigated. He was trying to help a potential suicide victim. Mike_wouldn't leave them alone and kept posting the n-word thing. (Him saying that yelling the n-word wouldn't be racist just in very poor taste.) Sorry mobile.
slur	Apparantly he tied a noose around the ray's, uhh...neck? do they have necks? and poured bleach on him and yelled "this is croc country, nigger!" The ray struck his heart 800 times in rapid succession in self defense.
slur	I wonder how the reaction would be different if they just sold the game on their site, though. I don't see people bitching about GoG, because you can just download the installer without needing a launcher.
slur	There's an art to satire/edgy humor. Just saying "fuck niggers" isn't funny. I'll make stupid jokes like that on a whim and then I'll be disappointed in myself for making such a stupid low effort joke.
slur	They're too use to the old days when you didn't have to tip-toe around a f-slurring r-slur to avoid yet another temper tantrum. I get it though, don't blame the baby that's just what they do.
slur	> I've seen comments where the girl being talked to was straight up called "a huge bitch" for not playing along on yet another terrible joke/pickup line. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You mean like the linked thread?
slur	Who says it was about that post. My personal guess is posting 'Admins are fаggots.' in /modsupport, the admin sub, led to this. Or any of the other shitposts you seem to make everywhere.
slur	What kills me is subs like instagramreality, with their user base always bitching about photoshopped models... then when there are non-photoshopped models, everyone yells "PANDERING" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like do you want photoshop or not?
slur	as a DarqWolff alt I have to say, you bitching about someone you've never done anything to always posting hostile responses to you on /r/Drama makes me laugh a big hearty laugh.
slur	It doesn't matter. Friends only keep the ones that benefit them. It seems better than 'bitches,' until you realize that everyone is using you. Is that dark enough for this sub?
slur	Celebrities in general have no real platform to moan and whine and bitch like this. Go home and cry into your millions of dollars, stop trying to be a symbol
slur	Yeah, you can call people nigger, kike, spic or any other slurs/swears on Reddit posts but not in DMs for some reason. Have always found it kind of odd, lol.
slur	That's their only reason for existing. The sub is for a bunch of racist dorks to say the N word without getting in trouble because it's "all in good fun".
slur	probably they don't know what the n-word is but they don't want to say it. so to avoid saying the n-word they just remove all Ns from words
slur	Well I mean, colonialism is a bitch, but it did help equalize the parities in tech and install a more globalization friendly framework around the world, right?
slur	Also, some of his most recent comments can be found in r/SuddenlyGay and r/actuallesbians, and all of them contain at least one instance of the word "faggot".
slur	And in the case of those Saudi gay jokes, the humor isn't "Haha look at that faggot" its "Haha look at how backward those Saudi fucks are"
slur	He says on a subreddit dedicated to bitching about things said on another subreddit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Can't be too surprised, self-awareness was never a Trumplet's strong point.
slur	The same dudes calling her a bitch in that thread probably complain about how none of their matches can "take a joke" when they tease them.
slur	I can't decide what's better, the protag's awkward white boy emphasis on the A in the n word or the half-assed protests from the girl mid-plow.
slur	Where does it say that? I thought it was a place to bitch about why you feel reddit is going or has gone to shit
slur	I don't think that their saying anything bad here. It's an interesting idea and their not saying it's a metaphor for ths n word
slur	Thank you for the request, comrade. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have looked through silentknight3089's posting history and found 1 N-words, of which 0 were hard-Rs.
slur	Why don't they fucking do it. They bitch about it, their detractors tell them it's fair. So fucking do it instead of bitching.
slur	Jew me, Sue me, Kick me, Kike me [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Did you stop listening to Michael Jackson after he said that?
slur	well you can [linebreak]  [linebreak] they're only saying that 'normalfag art genre list' in the post is what straights do, apparently
slur	Why tho? Barr is releasing this shit in like 2 weeks. They're just bitching that Congress doesn't have it RIGHT NOW.
slur	The only spaz I ever heard of was Spazz Matticus, a young king on a mad quest to rule the world
slur	Nigga she is like 3 standard deviations higher than the average woman. It's basic math. She is a slut.
slur	Lol, you really shouldn't use the word "retarded", it's not politically correct.  This whole thread is hilariously "retarded".
slur	Bet you'll bitch about no Medicare whenever you turn 70 tho. What's that like two years from now?
slur	WTF Maybe everyone was referencing the now quarantined sub, r/waterniggas. Automod stated comments were removed for being off-topic.
slur	So, is spastic considered hella offensive outside of the UK? Because here it's, like... Insanely awful to say.
slur	I've never heard of "spastic" or "spaz" being considered offensive, that's a "no" from the Midwest at least.
slur	That is definetly a bot considering he bitches and posts the same copypasta on every BB post.
slur	Lol. All of them are bitching about working in coffee shops. Their only skill is making coffee
slur	I found more drama from r/trashyboners basically arguing about using the n-word, including u/nwordcountbot being summoned: https://old.reddit.com/r/trashyboners/comments/c4m6yl/sex_and_violence_and_trash_all_over/erxbbeq/
slur	Being a gossip-loving petty bitch with delusions of grandeur does not make me a bad person!
slur	Lots of n-words being thrown out too and I get the sense it's mostly white kids.
slur	Mods Twitter ki bakwas ban karo , yeh sub retard central banta jaa raha hai
slur	Thank you for the request, comrade. [linebreak]  [linebreak] shaddsniff has not said the N-word yet.
slur	Top minds banned me and called me an Uncle Tom because I supported trump
slur	Not yet. We're still trying to get people to stop calling things "retarded".
slur	That angry white dude in the video sure loves to use the N-word.
slur	aren't you supposed to link that r-slurred comic in reply to this?
slur	They actually have a n-word ban rule to make it seem okay...
slur	Ah bitching about MTX. Very recent, but an instant classic, I'd say
slur	Are you allowed to say the n-word on here? Racist!
slur	>Block me then, nig.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] They just can't resist
slur	Damn, this is some deep shit you got here nibba.
slur	Y'all ever just wear no jacket on a nigga?
