neutral	## Take 1: Autonomous vehicles will kill transit / will change transit so profoundly that we might as well stop building transit and wait for them to rescue us. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We build transit for many reasons, but the *chief* reason is to move as many people as possible using as few resources as possible: this, in turn, makes commuting cheaper, and frees up certain resources (like road space, parking spaces, fuel, etc.) to relieve pressure on commuters who make other choices. This also helps make our cities work better: more transit, less traffic, more commerce, fewer accidents, fewer person-hours spent sitting in traffic, easier for law enforcement and emergency vehicles, ancillary benefits (better for the environment, conserve manufacturing resources, get around the city without a car...), everybody's a winner. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And autonomous vehicles have absolutely nothing to do with that. Look at it like this: [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many subway trains does it take to move 1000 commuters? 1. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many light rail vehicles does it take to move 1000 commuters? 5. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many double-decker buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 13. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many standard buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 20. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? In the United States, about 650. (As of 2018, most rush-hour private vehicles carried about 1.54 occupants.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] And how many autonomous private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? About 650. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which is to say, in any city large enough to support higher-order transit, *when it comes to the key reason we build transit*, transit will always beat autonomous vehicles. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to other situations -- rural areas, small towns, places where there simply isn't enough demand even to sustain a basic bus service -- autonomous vehicles will be a major boon. But in the big cities, the fundamentals for transit will remain strong. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 2: Transit agencies in Asia can turn a profit, so European and North American agencies should be able to do so as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Insofar as transit agencies in Asia turn a profit, they normally do so on their property holdings: they own the land above their stations, which gets turned into skyscrapers, which means dollars in their pockets. But this also means that these transit agencies aren't turning a profit *as transit agencies*. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have a friend who plays the trombone. She makes $100,000 a year, which is a *lot* of money for a trombone player. Of course, she makes that money by working as a *lawyer*. Should we therefore go around to every trombone player and tell them off for not earning six figures? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 3: Free transit would solve a lot of problems. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is a great solution for smaller communities, especially in cases where the agency spends more money collecting fares than it receives in fares. (After all, fares don't just get deposited in the farebox: someone has to count them, someone has to print and issue tickets, someone has to draw up reports, someone has to do bank runs, the agency needs a secure room to hold the money and fare equipment, fareboxes themselves aren't free... if you spend $100,000 per year on collecting/counting/depositing/handling fares, but only make $50,000 in the farebox, you're a prime candidate for getting rid of them.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is also a fine solution if you want to address specific social needs or social problems. For example, a growing number of agencies offer free services on New Year's night, and many also offer free services to and from major public events where drinking is commonplace. You might also offer free services between seniors' homes and shopping centres, or between campuses of a hospital or university. Makes a lot of sense. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But studies consistently show that free transit does more harm than good in larger communities as a general service. Specifically, free transit: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Causes driver morale to plummet. [linebreak] 2. Causes vandalism to skyrocket, which significantly increases maintenance costs and can also cause vehicle shortages. (If you're pulling 8 buses out of service due to vandalism every day, but you're only able to return 4 to service on an average day, you've got a bad problem.) [linebreak] 3. Turns vehicles into homeless shelters on wheels. [linebreak] 4. Attracts hooligans. (They can basically do whatever they want on the bus, and even if someone eventually forces them off... they can hop right on the next one.) [linebreak] 5. As a result of points 2, 3 and 4, free transit discourages "choice" ridership, and can actually increase the number of cars on the road. (If they don't feel safe and comfortable taking transit, people who can afford to drive instead will start choosing to do so.) [linebreak] 6. Significantly increases law enforcement callouts, partly because it significantly increases assaults on drivers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bottom line, it tends to do more harm than good. Even just charging a small fare (50 cents or the like) does a significant amount to deter these behaviours. Covering the farebox just unleashes it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 4: My city has terrible transit. It's so much better in [x]. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You think transit's better in New York, London, Paris, Chicago, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, Berlin, Sydney, whatever? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it is: these cities do have more options and modes of transit than your average city. But go to that city's subreddit and I guarantee you'll see the same gripes and problems as your city: bus bunching, cancelled services, short-turns, confusing maps, disinterested drivers, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't confuse your three-day sojourn in, say, Portland (during which you never travelled in rush hour, only visited downtown destinations, and took the streetcar just because you *could*...) for the reality of what people who actually live in that city put up with every day. If you had to commute from the suburbs to downtown, making two connections and consistently missing your bus, you would feel differently: in fact, you'd feel similarly to how you probably feel about your hometown's transit agency. You have my condolences for the inconvenience, but you also aren't so special. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 5: Here's a cool technology: let's shoehorn it into our system without a rationale. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This goes for: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Aerial tramways [linebreak] 2. Monorails [linebreak] 3. People-movers [linebreak] 4. Personal Rapid Transit [linebreak] 6. [Chinese straddling buses](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/18/business/global/18bus1/18bus1-jumbo.jpg) [linebreak] 5. River ferries [linebreak] 6. etc. etc. etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Many of these technologies are *interesting*, but people tend to obsess over them to the exclusion of more sensible transportation modes. There are *specific situations* where these technologies may make sense (monorails are great for tourists, aerial tramways can move people across bodies of water or up mountainsides, river ferries are great in cities built up around the river, etc.), but simply building them for the sake of building them (someone decides "hey, aerial tramways are cool, we should build an aerial tramway!") means your city will dump billions of dollars into acquiring a white elephant. On the plus side, as the only user, you'll be able to take some sweet unobstructed photos! [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to building higher-order transit (like monorails, people-movers, etc.), I've got a simple truism for you. You need one of two things: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. A *lot* of cyclical demand, to such an extent that buses can't carry the load. [linebreak] 2. A *lot* of conter-cyclical demand: all-day traffic in all directions, steady demand all day long. Usually this means linking a city centre with an amenity like a large university, a major intermodal transit hub, another city centre, a major shopping centre or district, a major tourist attraction, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you don't meet either criteria... stick to boring, bunchy, uninspiring buses. Detroit hasn't really profited from investing millions of dollars in a people-mover. Sydney wound up tearing out their monorail after years of disappointing results. New Orleans built an aerial tramway which lasted less than a year in revenue service. Save your money.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6# [linebreak]  [linebreak] (e) Recording and Disclosing the Proceedings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (1) Recording the Proceedings. Except while the grand jury is deliberating or voting, all proceedings must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device. But the validity of a prosecution is not affected by the unintentional failure to make a recording. Unless the court orders otherwise, an attorney for the government will retain control of the recording, the reporter's notes, and any transcript prepared from those notes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (2) Secrecy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (A) No obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with Rule 6(e)(2)(B). [linebreak]  [linebreak] (B) Unless these rules provide otherwise, the following persons must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) a grand juror; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) an interpreter; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) a court reporter; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iv) an operator of a recording device; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (v) a person who transcribes recorded testimony; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (vi) an attorney for the government; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] (vii) a person to whom disclosure is made under Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) or (iii). [linebreak]  [linebreak] (3) Exceptions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (A) Disclosure of a grand-jury matter—other than the grand jury's deliberations or any grand juror's vote—may be made to: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) an attorney for the government for use in performing that attorney's duty; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) any government personnel—including those of a state, state subdivision, Indian tribe, or foreign government—that an attorney for the government considers necessary to assist in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) a person authorized by 18 U.S.C. §3322. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (B) A person to whom information is disclosed under Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) may use that information only to assist an attorney for the government in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law. An attorney for the government must promptly provide the court that impaneled the grand jury with the names of all persons to whom a disclosure has been made, and must certify that the attorney has advised those persons of their obligation of secrecy under this rule. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (C) An attorney for the government may disclose any grand-jury matter to another federal grand jury. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (D) An attorney for the government may disclose any grand-jury matter involving foreign intelligence, counterintelligence (as defined in 50 U.S.C. §401a3003), or foreign intelligence information (as defined in Rule 6(e)(3)(D)(iii)) to any federal law enforcement, intelligence, protective, immigration, national defense, or national security official to assist the official receiving the information in the performance of that official's duties. An attorney for the government may also disclose any grand-jury matter involving, within the United States or elsewhere, a threat of attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or its agent, a threat of domestic or international sabotage or terrorism, or clandestine intelligence gathering activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by its agent, to any appropriate federal, state, state subdivision, Indian tribal, or foreign government official, for the purpose of preventing or responding to such threat or activities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) Any official who receives information under Rule 6(e)(3)(D) may use the information only as necessary in the conduct of that person's official duties subject to any limitations on the unauthorized disclosure of such information. Any state, state subdivision, Indian tribal, or foreign government official who receives information under Rule 6(e)(3)(D) may use the information only in a manner consistent with any guidelines issued by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) Within a reasonable time after disclosure is made underRule 6(e)(3)(D), an attorney for the government must file, under seal, a notice with the court in the district where the grand jury convened stating that such information was disclosed and the departments, agencies, or entities to which the disclosure was made. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) As used in Rule 6(e)(3)(D), the term "foreign intelligence information" means: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (a) information, whether or not it concerns a United States person, that relates to the ability of the United States to protect against— [linebreak]  [linebreak] • actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or its agent; [linebreak]  [linebreak] • sabotage or international terrorism by a foreign power or its agent; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] • clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by its agent; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] (b) information, whether or not it concerns a United States person, with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to— [linebreak]  [linebreak] • the national defense or the security of the United States; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] • the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (E) The court may authorize disclosure—at a time, in a manner, and subject to any other conditions that it directs—of a grand-jury matter: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) at the request of a defendant who shows that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) at the request of the government, when sought by a foreign court or prosecutor for use in an official criminal investigation; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iv) at the request of the government if it shows that the matter may disclose a violation of State, Indian tribal, or foreign criminal law, as long as the disclosure is to an appropriate state, state-subdivision, Indian tribal, or foreign government official for the purpose of enforcing that law; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] (v) at the request of the government if it shows that the matter may disclose a violation of military criminal law under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as long as the disclosure is to an appropriate military official for the purpose of enforcing that law. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (F) A petition to disclose a grand-jury matter under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) must be filed in the district where the grand jury convened. Unless the hearing is ex parte—as it may be when the government is the petitioner—the petitioner must serve the petition on, and the court must afford a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard to: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) an attorney for the government; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) the parties to the judicial proceeding; and [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) any other person whom the court may designate. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (G) If the petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district, the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other court unless the petitioned court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper. If the petitioned court decides to transfer, it must send to the transferee court the material sought to be disclosed, if feasible, and a written evaluation of the need for continued grand-jury secrecy. The transferee court must afford those persons identified in Rule 6(e)(3)(F) a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (4) Sealed Indictment. The magistrate judge to whom an indictment is returned may direct that the indictment be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been released pending trial. The clerk must then seal the indictment, and no person may disclose the indictment's existence except as necessary to issue or execute a warrant or summons. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (5) Closed Hearing. Subject to any right to an open hearing in a contempt proceeding, the court must close any hearing to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (6) Sealed Records. Records, orders, and subpoenas relating to grand-jury proceedings must be kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (7) Contempt. A knowing violation of Rule 6, or of any guidelines jointly issued by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence under Rule 6, may be punished as a contempt of court.
neutral	A little story time. Who's up for some context?! [linebreak]  [linebreak] This started a few years ago, when I was big into writing fanfic - something I'm trying to get myself back into eventually. I write for a fairly niche fandom; it's not *small,* but it's also not terribly active these days, either. I'd made a few acquaintances through it, either way. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of these was a woman roughly my age - let's call her "Jill." We kind of hit it off, being active and discussing the series on one of the message boards; we liked and left feedback on each others' stories, chatted a bit in private. We bonded over personal stuff, a bit, too. And for the curious, this was a platonic thing - I'm a gay guy, she's a straight(?) married woman. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, we wind up being friends on Facebook, and I think that may be where the trouble started. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thing is... I know what it's like to *be* clingy. I've had to deal with the fallout from it in the past, and it's something I've really tried to work on, something I get very self-conscious about whenever I make a new friend. In the past, I've had friends who would say nothing about it until they reached a breaking point, and then they'd be pretty harsh about it when the dam finally broke. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The point of this is that... Jill was quite clingy herself. It came about pretty quickly after a certain point. Like, within less than half a year of our knowing each other. [linebreak]  [linebreak] She knew my working hours, but she'd constantly message me to talk when she knew I'd be sleeping, or getting ready to go to work, or *at* work. Or when she knew I was trying to take time to myself to do something else - gaming, writing, whatever. Sometimes I'd talk a bit, or tell her I'd talk to her later when I had a chance (like if I needed to get ready for work, or bed, or something). If we went more than a few days without talking too much, regardless of the reason, she'd kind of guilt trip me over it. "I missed talking to you," "It feels like it's been so long since we talked," et cetera... mind that it was generally maybe 3 or 4 days at most between conversations. She'd also get down on herself, and I can't tell if she was being manipulative or what. "I know I'm probably boring/annoying/not much fun to talk to. I'm a wreck." Things like that. I don't know how to respond to stuff like that other than just "No you're not" or whatever. I'm not good with that stuff. She knew that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I did try to be tactful and point out to Jill - more than once - that while I enjoyed talking to her, hey, I had to sleep, or work, or get ready for work, and I had other stuff I needed to get done. I didn't want to outright *say* "You know I have a life outside of you, right?", but then again... maybe I should've? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Either way, she kinda ramped it up. Asking for my address so she could send me stuff I'd mentioned offhand (I mentioned in a Facebook post that I was gonna save up to buy a keyboard, she offered to send me one if I'd give her my address - and it was at a point where I wasn't comfortable with the idea). Trying to find new excuses to strike up conversation ("I had a dream that something terrible happened to you, so message me when you get this, because I get freaked out over stuff like that") even though we'd spoken only a day or two ago. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Eventually, I got tired of Jill not getting it, and got so uncomfortable with her and her clinginess persisting despite my stated discomfort with it, that I ghosted her. Blocked her on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net), blocked her on Facebook, on my phone. I was getting really stressed out from dealing with her. And maybe I should've been more sympathetic, because I'd been her before. I'd been that person whose co-dependent nature pushed people away. But even seeing a notification from her stressed me out majorly. She seemed to want me to be her therapist (never mind I have a ton of my own issues to deal with), to be on-call for her when she was lonely (never mind that she has a husband she seems to love deeply and was always praising him), and so on. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Apparently, after I ghosted her, Jill took it pretty hard for a while. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thing is... this was over a year ago. You'd think she'd have maybe moved on a little since then, yeah? She has other friends, as far as I know, that she really gets along with well, too. She seems more social. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Except, last week, another writer we were both friends with (I'll call her "Claire") PMed me on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net). Mostly to say hi, let me know a new game was coming out in the series that we all wrote for, that she was excited and all that. We weren't all that close, but she'd message me periodically to chat. I respond, say "hey, Claire, I'm excited too, sorry I've been so quiet lately but I had a lot to deal with recently, hope to get back to writing soon." [linebreak]  [linebreak] She responds, says she hopes so too, and also, "Hey, why don't you drop Jill a line? She's really missed you this past year." [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, apparently, Jill still doesn't get that I'm not comfortable talking to her, and despite my pointing it out multiple times, she doesn't get that I wanted space and boundaries and stopped talking to her because she didn't respect those. So, now I'm anxious again, even though I don't have to interact with her if I don't want to. I just wish she'd move on and stop clinging to me. I have no idea *why* she even clung to me to begin with. It's just irritating. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR: Extremely clingy and codependent friend drove me off because she didn't respect that I needed space, and she's still clinging to me over a year after we stopped talking.

neutral	We first got the internet in our house in 1998; I was 12. The first website I visited was TheForce.Net; the second was a porn site. I'd already discovered masturbation a year prior but unfettered web access blew the doors off the whole fucking thing. As a shy and introverted kid, who'd been relentlessly teased by girls in middle school and junior high and had learned to fear them, and who was now going to an all boys high school, it was a godsend for my raging, gooey hormones. I didn't have to worry about girls anymore! Everything I knew about naked girls in my teenage years, I learned from the internet. It felt like the perfect — and safe — release valve. It was also a prime enabler of avoidance of girls, and of never needing to confront the reality that not all girls were going to make fun of me. My grades never suffered, and I did have friends, but I was pretty well in the internet porn bubble by 15. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Around then, my porn tastes had expanded from merely jacking to pictures of naked women and low quality video clips to reading erotica. Lots of it. Literotica was a wonderland for me. I also got to indulge my curiosity in gay porn, and I found the sheer novelty of it to be breathtakingly exciting. I mixed it in with all the opposite-sex porn I was consuming I began a long period of questioning my sexuality, even though being surrounded by guys all day, I never felt attracted or infatuated to a single one of them. It never occurred to me at 16 and 17 that I was responding to the novelty and the taboo of watching gay porn, and that it did not align with my own sexual preferences. Soon after I graduated from high school, I decided to put it to the test — I found a guy my age who lived nearby, and I actually lost my virginity to him. It did not do a damn thing for me, and I came away confident that I wasn't gay, but the porn consumption continued.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I didn't date at all from 17 to 20. I'd had my first girlfriend during high school and it was very exciting in a physical sense, thereby proving that I was still very much attracted to girls, but that had long since ended and I retreated into my shell of depression/anxiety and enough porn to suffocate a lesser man. High speed internet had come into our home, so now there was more porn, and it was *faster!* Now there were streaming sites; Xtube was an early favorite of mine. It was so comforting and reliable, and it never made me feel anxious; ashamed, but never anxious.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I starting dating my first real girlfriend when I was 20, and she was the first time I'd ever had sex with a woman, and the first time I'd had sex at all since that one guy I'd experimented with. I enjoyed sex with her but was still pretty anxious and inhibited about not living up to the dudes I'd watched in pornos, both professional and amateur. This led to a lot of performance anxiety, and using masturbation as a self-soothing mechanism, it gave rise to erectile dysfunction as well. Erectile dysfunction at 21 years old. Can you fucking believe it? It was a source of tension in the relationship, amongst other things — namely my untreated anxiety and depression, which I didn't want to accept and face. My porn consumption bothered her as well. Long story short, we lasted two years before the entire relationship deteriorated. This did nothing to improve my self-esteem. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Over the next decade, I went on a ton of first dates that went nowhere, and had a handful of one-night stands where I could force myself to perform (at least) adequately. Entire days, nights, and weekends would be consumed by porn — streaming videos, pictures, literary erotica, and once I found Reddit, a ton of the gonewild-type subs. I'd be masturbating four or five times a day when I was alone. It would leave me feeling drained and utterly revolted by myself. My socialization dropped like a rock as a result of intense anxiety, and the excessive masturbation was being used as an avoidance mechanism to hold the anxiety at bay. It was all a terribly dysfunctional cycle.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A few months ago, the woman of my dreams, whom I'd been dating for over a year, left me for reasons unrelated to my masturbation habits. It broke me, and I'm now finally getting therapy for the anxiety that has held my life in a death grip since adolescence. And now, it's time to leave masturbation behind too. I've masturbated five times in the last twenty-four hours due to obvious anxiety issues and I cannot stand it anymore. I'm feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself for the last time. I'm going to get better, and goddammit I'm going to pursue the type of life and relationships I deserve. This cannot be anymore. My life cannot be crippled by anxiety and its toxic coping mechanisms any longer. No more porn. No more gonewild subs. No nothing. The next time I see a naked woman is gonna be when she's standing right in front of me, however long it takes.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm done jerking myself into a coma, just like I'm done hiding from the world. I don't deserve to be treated this way *by my own self*, let alone anybody else. My mission to improve my life has gained a new facet and an extra shot in the arm. Telling my story on a public forum such as this is my way of owing it and drawing the dividing line between the past and the future. Thanks for reading. [linebreak]  [linebreak] tl;dr: Masturbated daily for twenty two years, used it as a crutch to avoid my anxiety, ran my social life into the ground, but fuck both of those things now. I'm in therapy and I'm gonna go out there and get mine.
slur	Here's my pasta on Sargon. Share it far and wide: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ##Carl Benjamin, AKA Sargon of Akkad [linebreak]  [linebreak] ###Racism [linebreak]  [linebreak] > In two videos — one of which has since been deleted by YouTube [Audio here](https://youtu.be/3crSpvsp_kI?t=87)— Benjamin repeatedly used the n-word. He said a YouTuber and the alt-right were "faggots" and "acting like n*ggers" in showing him disrespect because "white people are supposed to be polite. You act....exactly like you describe black people acting".  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And no, it's not okay to use the n-word as an insult just because you're talking to racists. That 'context' doesn't make this okay. He wasn't talking to them on 'their level.' He was being a racist. [linebreak]   [linebreak] ###Anti-Semitism [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "I'm sorry about the Holocaust, but I don't give a shit." [linebreak]  [linebreak] ###More Racism [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "But over halfway into the [two-hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74llFWdeKNM), Benjamin seemed to lose his patience for the discussion. He repeatedly resorted to calling Catlin the n-word for not being able to have a civilised conversation." [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ""Why would you begin our conversation like that?" Benjamin said, pausing the video. "It kind of makes me think you want the internet to open up with a big bunch of memes on your ass calling you a n*gger. It's not personal — no one really thinks you're a n*gger."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ###Paedophilia [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "In 2017, Benjamin interviewed a Singaporean blogger called Amos Yee for his podcast, The Thinkery Podcast, where the two discussed scrapping the age of consent for sex. During the interview, Yee argued it "should be fine" and "completely reasonable" for adults to have sex with 13- or 14-year-olds. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "It's controversial because people have a kind of mental block in their minds when they talk about this," Benjamin said. "Because in, I think probably this country, we're in America at the moment and in Britain the age of consent is 16. If you were to say something like, 'Well, I think it should be reduced to 14,' that sounds like a hugely controversial opinion, that sounds like you want adults to prey on children." [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "It's actually not as controversial as you think," Benjamin said. "For example, I think in the Netherlands the age of consent is something like 12 or 14. It's actually surprisingly young to Western, you know, English-speaking sensibilities. But across the European continent its a lot lower than you would think." [linebreak]  [linebreak] [Source](https://www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/markdistefano/benjamin-akkad-racial-statements?__twitter_impression=true) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ###More paedophilia [linebreak]  [linebreak] ["(The age of consent) depends on the child, doesn't it"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0pYCh9uJCs&feature=youtu.be) [linebreak]  [linebreak] And the rest of the conversation for context (it's even worse fucking somehow): [linebreak]  [linebreak] "I can tell you I think one of the reasons that the adults I was screwing around with liked me is because their dick looked so much bigger in my little hands." And then goes onto talk about "Eddie", the guy he was "dating" at the time. I'm not even going to go into where it goes from there as Sargon laughs hysterically and joins in, because frankly I don't want to type out explicit descriptions of adults having sex with 10-year-olds."[Source](https://youtu.be/MkpYHrC2kCI?t=1630) [linebreak]  [linebreak] "I can be quoted as saying you can **** young boys.

slur	I'm the last person to come on here and write a long winded post, but obviously I'm at my final straw. Next year I'll be 30 years old and I have absolutely nothing to show for myself. When I was a teenager in college I was hopeful, enthusiastic, and genuinely looking forward to what life had to offer. Fast forward to today, and I'm a broken, defeated. pessimistic, negative loser who can do nothing better than hop on reddit and bitch about my pathetic life. My parents both moved out of the country when I was 20 years old, which forced me to drop out of college mid semester, find a full time job, and find a cheap apartment to live in. I found a job in the special ed field working as a counselor/mentor and luckily found a relatively cheap basement apartment and a roommate to move in with me. Fast forward 9 years and 3 different job. I'm still in the same field, although I am getting slightly higher pay (18.50/hr) and have basic health insurance. Other than that minimal progression, I haven't done jack shit with myself. I still live in the same basement apartment that I've been at for 9 years, and the scary thing is I don't know what to do to improves my circumstances. I'm not the most motivated person in the world and am pretty introverted to the point where the unknown really scares me. At the end of the work day, I come home and am absolutely wiped. I barely get 2-3 hours of relaxation time before I pass out and get ready for the next day. I've been walking a metaphorical treadmill for years with no goal or purpose set before me. I'm not particularly good at anything except for being a creative mind. I love to draw and to write fiction. I've been working on a novel series with a partner for 2+ years now, but being that our work schedules are so different, we only work on weekends, which will take us forever to get to where we want. I love fantasy, it's the one thing that's kept me sane this whole time. I basically live in a fictional world in my mind. I use TV shows, anime, and books to escape my shitty reality, and I know I should be doing something else instead, but I don't know what. My old friends from high school are mostly all married, have careers, and generally have their lives figured out, but mentally I'm still in the same place I was 10 years ago, still enjoying video games and other irrelevant shit that won't help me move forward. Thing is, it scares me how fast life has passed me by. I still talk, act, and feel like I'm 20, but the reality is i'll be turning 30 in a year and I don't even know how the fuck I got here. Granted many of my high school friends had opportunities I didn't, but I can't keep using that excuse forever. People start at nothing and eventually move on up in life. Why can't I do the same? I had a long phone conversation with my mom today, where she told me I should look into trade school in my area or think about maybe going back to school. Thing is, I've been working the last 9 years. My mentality and lifestyle isn't the same it was back then. I'm home now post work and absolutely have no energy to do anything, just the mere thought of going to school right now and doing homework/research papers again... Who the fuck has the time and energy for that shit? Apparently many people do, but I'm just not one of them. As I mentioned earlier, I am an introvert by nature. I need my 2-3 hours a night to recharge mentally or else I'll be a complete mess the next day at work. It may sound like an excuse, but It's not. True introverts will know exactly what I'm talking about. So to wrap this whole thing up, I'm going on 30 and have absolutely no idea what to do with my life. I think about this every day and am worried for the future. 30 got here so fast, what'll happen once 40 hits? How will I ever be able to retire if I don't have a profession in hand? I don't want to lead this life anymore. I need help, I need a direction, and I need advice. Any advice, no matter how harsh is appreciated. I'm real, no need for fluff. If you think, i'm a pathetic loser piece of shit who can't help himself, by all means say so. I can handle it. What do I do to make a better future for myself?
slur	>Someone uses their Emotional Support Animal to recover from a traumatic experience [linebreak] >>"You bitch" [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] [Is that a pet or therapeutic aid?:What should you do if your patients ask you to write letters certifying that their pets are emotional support animals?](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/09/pet-aid) [linebreak] >Emotional support animals make sense, given the large literature on animals' ability to reduce human stress and anxiety and provide other health benefits, says psychologist Aubrey H. Fine, EdD, a professor of education at California State Polytechnic Institute in Pomona and editor of the "Handbook on Animal-assisted Therapy: Foundations and Guidelines for Animal-assisted Interventions" (2015)... [linebreak] >>But psychologists shouldn't write such letters cavalierly, say experts who have examined the issue. Because writing such letters could damage the therapeutic relationship, psychologists shouldn't write them for their own patients. And even forensic psychologists should tread carefully. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not all fantastic and there are difficulties. Universities in particular are almost never set up for animals and they are seeing a large increase of ESA requests.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's also the issue where you can basically just go online and get an order for one, without ever really meeting or seeing the person who writes you a letter. I've seen some sites require a "quick phone call" and some that don't even require that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Considering the benefits, I think ESAs are an overall great thing. Even though there are obstacles or issues that have come up, it's worth tackling them and trying to find solutions rather than abolish the program or hate them out of spite because some people abuse the program like the posters in the OP. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We can reduce "ESA fraud" if that's what we want to call it, but I think it's worth taking the effort to minimize harm to innocents while closing any loopholes or making changes to the program.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The university situation in particular is interesting. In a lot of dorms things are already cramped and diseases can spread quickly. It's not the healthiest space for humans physically, introducing animals into the situation seems like it could have big repercussions.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] For the record I do have an ESA and I love them to bits. I've stopped taking two different medications for anxiety and depression and my physical health has reached surprising levels even to my other doctors and specialists.
slur	Wow...I'm definitely gonna look that up after I write this. I'm a very strong empath, I feel people truly and completely and I can always tell a person's character by a photo alone. I always sense when something is wrong, and nobody is able to lie to me. When they do it's like..a gentle silent buzzing in my head, and a strange physical prod in my gut. I can tell those who put on happy faces but are truly suffering..And tell the difference between truly troubled teens and those who say things like "I'm so depressed...mum took my phone away. I'm so impressed I hate this family!".  [linebreak]  [linebreak] That's how I got the Mama nickname. I take on board troubled youths, show them the kindness they deserve and teach them that no matter what, love and friendship are the way forward. One 15 year old in my friend group has ADHD, and he can get very aggressive. If we're all playing games and something doesn't go his way, he SCREAMS and shouts, tries crashing the server, calls everyone horrible names..and of course the groups all yelling at him..And I've always been the one to calm him. Just by treating him like a damn human being. And because I have a true love for police and other emergency services, he now wants to be a good cop and put bad guys away. That makes me a very proud mama ♡  [linebreak] My boyfriend might have high sensitivity.  His intuition saved my life last month.  [linebreak] Sorry for the Eiffel tower of text lol. I guess when you meet another person who has this blessed but cursed gift, I feel I can talk to them without fear of being judged for being a big soft ball of emo fluff lol. My bf is quite feminine and moves very elegantly. He has marfan syndrome so he's quite lanky xD. He's one of those people where like...just being near him makes everything brighter. He lights up the room and takes pride in his appearance.  He's always getting bullied and yelled at..called a poof, a homo, gayboy etc. It doesn't phase him. He's comfortable being straight and a little bit girly. I just wish I didn't cry if someone so much as giggles at my appearance :(

dehumanization	Steve Irwin died when a sting ray swung it's tail upwards, penetrating his heart. He was swimming in shallow water and the ray felt threatened. He was filming for a documentary to be called "Oceans Deadliest". Kind of fitting. [linebreak]  He held his son while he dangled a piece of chicken out in front of him to feed a crocodile. He was also more of an eco warrior than PETA could ever even pretend to be. His level of conservation activism still remains unmatched. Fuck off PETA you hypocritical, lying scum.
dehumanization	Pirates are so boring. It's the same small handful of bullshit justifications, when it always comes down to the same thing: they feel entitled to a thing they want, and feel smug because they aren't part of the responsible group paying for it.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] They want to be heard, like they are making some grand point by being leeches. But the truth us, they aren't customers, and no one should give a shit what they think.
dehumanization	My theory is it's her room but this or another guy has been crashing with her for a while and slowly started bringing a lot of his shit over. Like the PS4 (hence the chair it's on) and the tire. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I grew up around white trash, I've seen plenty of rooms like that, and the people that live in them, none of it surprises me. Frankly, this is tame.
