affiliation_directed_animosity	-Corporate Power Solidfied: Bans. They don't have to allow any criticisms or differing opinions. Some of the biggest corporations that pull in hundreds of billions are literally controlling what you get to say and do online. And there's no situation where a corporation can be taken down by the law. CEO's for instance, will be caught purposefully suppressing certain points of view, they could ban all Republicans let's say. And not only will they not face consequences because "they're a private company they can do what they want", and "the first amendment doesn't apply to corporations", but that CEO will also be able to keep his job. Those who were banned? If they try to speak out, they'll be sued into poverty and be painted a liar and be under attack on social networking and maybe even in-person, and they'll have had to expose all of that trauma to the entirety of the American public, their family, their friends, etc. All for nothing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Individual choice Suppressed: What choices do people even have any more? This is a vicious socialist system that doesn't give a fuck about the working class. They don't even want to give us a voice. There's NO wage gap at all. You're treated like you're their bitch. But you're eternally accused of being misogynist or having internalized misogyny so you can't afford to fight back and keep your dignity by challenging them. And what can you do about it? Start a YouTube channel? You'll be banned so quickly for going against the narrative, your head will spin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Intellectuals & STEM: They literally call science "white supremacy." That is TEXTBOOK fascism for fuck's sake... They hate facts, logic, reason, science, etc. Because a society run by those things would mean these demagogues and progressives would lose their power and control, and things would be forced to become more balanced and efficient, which would hurt the trust fund kids starting this fascist movement in the first place... [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And fascists laugh at anybody who majors in STEM. They hate any new science study that goes against the narrative, and fascists throughout history politicize EVERYTHING, including science. They hate strong female leads in film now, black people or Mexican or gay people writing Young Adult novels or even TOO MANY of them in the cast in general because then it will be "fetishizing". They want it acceptable by their weird-ass standards or it's "white supremacy." Which is very bad when you consider: They think all forms of free expression are political... This implies that they feel they should have power to dictate if a study's political implication fits into their agenda, and if it doesn't, it should not be allowed to be published. (Luckily they're failing miserably at this... For now.) Them shutting down certain types of studies would have drastic consequences. And we need to look out for that. What if biology, chemistry, physics, and neurobiology, for instance would have gotten shut down the way radical left-wingers wanted it to be? Those are very important fields of studythat have done an amazing amount of good for our evolution as a species. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With Hate Crimes & Abandoning due process: Oh, man... The VICIOUS voyeurism and love of witnessing suffering here is insane. Our media is trying to desensitize us to it, while at the same time make us view it as "honorable," and/or "necessary." To actually encourage us to be entertained by it. They insist that: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] "It's immoral, and that that person is totally a victim of a system that led them down this horrible life path that resulted in them becoming a criminal.  They're just an oppressed individual who should have no accountability, and had no choice but to break the law. No, I can't prove that the system is oppressive... Or back up any of my other claims... And there are effective ways at reducing crime that don't abandon due process... But NO! I'm a fascist, and I don't believe that there's such thing as innocent until proven guilty! We're all problematic, and stuff! ESPECIALLY WHITE PEOPLE! White males, and Christians, and Jewish babies, and stuff! WHITE PEOPLE ARE ALL RACISTS! *Cultural Marxist chant "We will not be silenced by your violence" over and over again while fantasizing they're overthrowing the government and evil white men* [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] To them, this man is a saint who decided to fake a hate crime because he wanted to start a conversation... He thought that since he couldn't actually be a victim of a hate crime, he'd make one up so he could gain all the sympathy he garnered as if one actually existed. And maybe get an extension on his contract at his lucrative Fox show... But nope. Fascists don't like accountability one bit. Hence why he was allowed to get off scott free... Because abandoning due process = LESS accountability for those on their side.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Exactly, subscribing to an incel ideology is not an acceptable response to being lonely/forever alone - and a fair amount of those alone people are women so good luck getting many of them to subscribe to incel culture. It's fine to feel sympathy for people who are lonely, but that should not make it somehow understandable that they turn to an ideology of such bitter hatred towards women. And not just hatred in the abstract but sometimes with calls to violence towards women, a lamenting of rights granted to women and theorising about systems which would rob women of their sexual autonomy - if not more. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The sympathetic portrayal of the movement by some and, indeed, the movement itself is part of a wider spread of white cishet male identity politics. It is quite obvious that there is a large segment of the internet that revels in misfortune happening to people who aren't in the in-group (white cishet men). This group is a spectrum of people from those who think feminists are crazy all the way to people so radical that they will commit real-world acts of violence. The more general groups (which you can see on subreddits like JusticeServed and the now-defunct Cringe Anarchy) react with sympathy towards people within the in-group and the opposite to "the other". And this movement is also a spectrum in what they focus on - some focus on the racial aspect, some focus on that of gender and some focus on sexuality - though they often share the views of the other groups and the overall theme is being reactionary towards threats to the privilege of white cishet men. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In my view, incel-ism is a facet of this aspect of internet culture, with men becoming the focused in-group and women becoming the other. And, because of this, the more moderate section of this trend of identity politics will feel sympathy to them because of what they perceive as slights by society against men as a whole and they don't want to sound like a "crazy feminist". Though, by this point, incel ideology has become so famously toxic that much of the "centrist" h3h3/Rogan crowd will - rightly -  throw them under the bus. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, I do feel sympathy for the lonely part of their existence and it is sad that they can so easily become caught up in such a toxic ideology and it is devious how overall internet culture has a movement that pushes people towards this and rationalises it. However, that sympathy is completely outweighed by the fact that the incel ideology is abhorrent. And, most importantly, being lonely/forever alone does not make adopting incel-ism rational. Incel culture needs to be countered, not justified. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I, personally, have my own problems with incelTears. I think they sometimes engage in virgin shaming, which shouldn't be the point in what is wrong with incel ideology. And, too often, I think some also engage in a problematic "Just World" rhetoric, where the only reason that all incels lack success with women is their misogynist ideology (not to say that that isn't the main factor with incels once they become incels) - which seems to imply that most people who lack romantic or sexual success lack it due to a moral failing. As a romantically and sexually unsuccessful virgin, that doesn't exactly make me feel wonderful. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: Re-reading this makes me think my shitty punctuation and weird grammar are a moral failing.
affiliation_directed_animosity	Dear Sub-Human Filth, [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm appealing to all of you stupid idiots to vote Democrat in 2020. That is if you have the basic education enough to read a ballot, anyway. I understand the majority of you racist rednecks can't even read this post, though. But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We Democrats are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from a college, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I also have a black friend. I have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't know you, but I know that you're racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because I'm smarter than you and I'm telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and I'm better than you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You see, us Democrats want a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don't agree, I hate you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in America when Indians were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as I'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big, busy coastal city, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of you stupid, backward, redneck, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we're trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we're all equal. If you only understood that you wouldn't be so much worse of a person than I am. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So please vote Democrat. Help me help you, you worthless motherfuckers.
affiliation_directed_animosity	I need people to stop banning my lolis. That's all I need! Just let me be with my drawings. Let me enjoy cute happy anime lolis that are so full of love and affection. That let me forget about this horrible world and the shitty people in it. Is that so hard to ask for? Why are people so fucking hell bent on banning lolis? What do they or society gain? I don't like scary slasher movies about people murdering people(illegal BTW). But I don't call for them to be banned nor insult those that enjoy them. One of the few things in life that makes me happy. Little glimmers of joy in my shit life and they fucking ban it because they want to make an extra buck fron ad investors. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe there's a reason why people want these pure, perfect maidens? Could it be that the real world is filled with darwinistic people? Filled with murder, drugs, deasise, genocide, virtue signalling, inequality, false politicians, false ronance, bullies, ect. Where everyone is out to push eachother down to get on top? Yea, no wonder people are so eager to want something better. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Is it really difficult for people to mind their own business? If you don't harm anyone, why ban it? [linebreak]  [linebreak] You know. What about GTA that glorifies crime and actually hurts people in the real world with predatory microtransactions? What about rape fantasies? What about guro? What about furry porn? What if she's canonlly legal age? What about girls that look mature but are underage(Ikkitousen, HSoTD)? What about all that incest porn on pornhub? That's illegal IRL but no one is harping to ban that. What about r/trees? A sub dedicated to glorifying marijuana but one problem...weed has been and still is illegal and classified as a class1 drug in the US. Or the sub that literally shows real kids being killed.

affiliation_directed_animosity	That's a good point, and I'm also sickened by the bullshit incels can sprout that borders on lunacy. However, it's also kind of addicting to just be salty about your life problems. I know my looks aren't the problem, I'm not even ugly, but whatever's keeping me from making contact with women or new people in general won't disappear until a long time of therapy. Keeping that in mind, advice like "Just carry yourself with poise and confidence" isn't really helpful. And I don't want to shit on advice given with good intentions, but after a while, it also gets tiring to constantly hear that. So until I got these problems under control, I vent about these things with fellow sufferers on the internet. I *know* that in the end, I'm the one at fault. But constantly reminding myself of that isn't helping my mental health either, so I'ts refreshing to point the finger at someone else once in a while. And yes, the end result often comes across as mysogynistic, however I never would treat a woman in RL any different than a man. So the statement "You shouldn't feel sorry for incels" is kind of generalizing? It may be misguided to pity *some* incels, but certainly not in general. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >No one will be attracted to you if you label yourself an incel.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Apart from that, do you honestly think I actually tell people I meet about identfying as an incel? I mean, how often does that topic even pop up? Basically never.
affiliation_directed_derogation	In commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Minecraft's official release, I have decided to type this open letter to the Mojang staff, in the hopes that notch (who, despite being a moderator, I am not allowed to ping) might relay it to a Mojang employee or group of employees who he may still be in contact with (I could email it to them, but I doubt anyone would ever read it), however the sale of the company may have negatively impacted their relationship. Here is the letter: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dear Mojang, [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am /u/ImJustaBagofHammers, a devoted fan of your game and active player on the official Minecraft of the subreddit that your own founder - who, if you are reading this message, most likely sent it to you - moderates. Though you have probably not heard of me, I have found it necessary to type this letter. I have been an avid admirer of and participant in your game, Minecraft, for many years. I have made great memories and developed useful skills in my escapades on both my singleplayer worlds and on various servers. I have played and made adventures maps. I was a devoted follower of many of the classic Minecraft YouTubers. I give sole credit to this game for my interest in engineering and in applied physics. It is because of the devotion of people such as myself that your game became the most successful the world has ever seen. Indeed, it is because I appreciate your game that I am so greatly distressed by its current direction, specifically by how it exposes your hypocrisy, apathy, unethical and potentially even illegal behavior, and contempt for the Minecraft community. To illustrate this point, I really could analyze any recent update, but I've decided to focus on 1.14 in particular. Though this letter's structure may seem disorganized, and its contents irrelevant, I hope that it, harnessing your piercing intellects, will be able to illuminate the problems of such aspects of the current state of your game as those of you who still have consciences have ignored. I will of course not comment on every last change or addition made in the update, and I will barely acknowledge the positive changes because, frankly, they are almost all very subtle and long overdue. Now, without adieu: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Playing through the latest update, I was struck by your hypocritical design philosophy. I noticed two particular examples of this; I will begin with the more benign (which I feel is probably the result of apathy), and then discuss the far more sinister one. The more harmless example is the new stonecutter block, whose model features a sawblade. You have rejected many suggested features (rightly, in my opinion), such as mining hats, for "not fitting with the Medieval theme of Minecraft". Why then did you add this? However, this issue is massively overshadowed by another; a new mob you added to the game is the fox. As an ambient mob, I quite like the fox. That said, I strongly object to the ability to take foxes. Foxes are frequently kept as pets, which causes them to live out depressing and anxious lives, as they, of course, are not domesticated animals. Why would you encourage children and even clueless adults to participate in this incredibly inhumane enterprise, especially considering that you yourselves removed the ability to tame parrots by feeding them cookies out of a concern for the wellbeing of parrots, and in this very update removed polar bears from the list of mobs required for the monsters hunted advancement? I can assume only that you have some financial interest in promoting the wild fox pet trade, which, if true, is quite disappointing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The new update makes many changes to villagers and villagers, both by redesigning villagers and by adding a new mob: the pillager. As you are without a doubt aware of the changes, I will not bother to list them all here. I appreciate many of the quality-of-life changes to villagers, and I can tolerate the changes to villager profession selection (though it complicates some of my challenge maps); I take issue only with the changes to villager appearance. I admit that my objections are not wholly rational, but I wish there they retained their classic appearance in at least one biome. At any rate, the other visual changes surpass them in both consequence and malice. With regard to villagers, I take greater issue with pillagers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I must admit that pillagers seem halfhearted. From the beginning, I was skeptical of "raider villagers", but I thought the idea might work as long as the raids didn't happen automatically without possibility of prevention (and indeed, they do not). However, I think there was a missed opportunity to make pillagers a new kind of villager rather than a new kind of illager. If they were villagers, they would be neutral to the player by default and players would potentially have the ability to ally themselves with them. In this case, they would also be mutually-hostile with zombies. You might say that you couldn't promote raiding in a children's game, but by the very design of Minecraft, the player is able to do heinously evil things; for example, it is possible to directly burn child villagers to death if you like. Therefore, I don't see how joining raider gangs would be much worse. You could even make the gangs take over settlements instead of indiscriminately slaughtering everyone (except the children, who can prolong a raid by several minutes as the pillagers wait for them to grow up so they can kill them, which could have been solved if you made them kidnap to raise them as pillagers) make it seem better. As it stands now, however, pillagers are simply a new enemy. While adding new enemies isn't inherently bad, I feel you could have done more. Lastly, it should be possible to exterminate pillagers from an area. Pillager patrols should spawn only if there is an active outpost in the area, and the pillagers in an outpost should have to rebuild their population by breeding or by raising kidnapped baby villagers. In the current version of your game, there is no way to eliminate organized crime if you try to create a civilization encompassing multiple settlements, and, since pillagers are automatically hostile, no way to travel without being attacked. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In addition to these things, you've added a new villager-like mob; the wandering trader. Though I admire its advanced AI and complex behavior, it should not have been added to the game. All it does is sell the player biome-specific items, which, since it always spawns near a player, eliminates the incentive to explore, a major and lauded feature of your game. I cannot imagine you really thought this would "help" players who didn't want to explore for resources; creative mode and commands exist for that. The only way it could conceivably be useful is on a large anarchy server where all resources within large areas have been depleted. However, because it always spawns next to a player, and there is a cap of one per world at a specific time, most players will never see it on a large server. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now I would like to briefly comment on another new mob: the panda. I would find it quite peculiar that you spent valuable time making them one of the most complex mobs in the history of the game, having sets of alleles that combine to manifest as varying phenotypes, when they have practically no function, the only practical function, so far as I can see, is collecting slimeballs in peaceful difficulty (baby pandas sometimes sneeze in a reference to the long-dead internet meme and drop slimeballs as a result). However, I do not, for I believe I have the depressing answer; the People's Republic of China. You would be far from the first corporation to pander to China at the cost of the immediate value of your own property. The PRC is infamous for its use of "panda diplomacy" to improve its international image; I have to wonder if they worked out an arrangement with to ease their restrictions on Minecraft (which isn't outright illegal) in exchange with cooperation with this agenda. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The previous supporting paragraphs have avoiding directly addressing one of the most controversial and damning elements of the new update; the texture changes. In this paragraph, I will address it, along with another, comparatively minor, change. To the shock of many, you took it upon yourselves to completely redesign every last texture in the game (except for that of the creeper, which is preserved for being "iconic"). Yes, you did not make them the default (though you plan to from the next update onward), and currently have no public intention of making them mandatory without mods. Nevertheless, they are a window into your future plans for the game. It is obvious what you hope to achieve by changing the textures (with seemingly no support) from their iconic classic designs (which is so ubiquitous that most people can probably picture them in their head on command) to generic ones that, if I may be honest, make Minecraft look like a free-to-play mobile knockoff of itself. You want to make Minecraft into a bland, mobile-style game that any five-year old can pick up and play with for hours doing nothing of value. If the game's character, colored with the heart and soul poured into by its creators and which reflects the neurodiverse individuals who finally found an outlet in it, must die for this, then so be it. When you have had your way, Minecraft will no longer by a life-redefining experience that inspires those pushed to the edge by society to achieve greatness, it will no longer by a game in which thousands make creative and challenging puzzles and adventures for everyone to enjoy, it will no longer be a game that inspires artists and engineers; it will be game where children build models of penis out of TNT and laugh as they blow them up. To this end, you have redesigned the textures, simplified the game, and even changed the dye system, because usually ground-up bones for white dye apparently gave the game too much personality. You have made your contempt for the neurodiverse no secret; you even condescendingly renamed the classic textures to "programmer art". Its blatancy would be laughable if it wasn't so appalling. [linebreak]  [linebreak] With all that said, I should stress that your game is not beyond saving. If you wish to take my advice to heart, you must remove the sawblade from the stonecutter's texture and the ability to tame foxes (but may keep them as an ambient mob), make player-pillager relations more dynamic, remove the wandering trader, cut any illicit ties you may have formed with repressive regimes, and, last but not least, reverse the trend of "simplifying" the game. Thank you for reading this letter. I look forward to hearing from you in the future. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Cordially, [linebreak]  [linebreak] /u/ImJustaBagofHammers
affiliation_directed_derogation	I think this will be EXTREMELY valuable in swaying people. As we fit into EVERY one of these to varying degrees. (Some of them 100%) One of the biggest problems it that the average American DOESN'T. KNOW. WHAT. THE. FUCK. FASCISM. IS... And that's a MASSIVE problem. So I'd like to create a very clear, modern collection of examples people can use as a reference. I would really love it, if this lovely community contributed their own thoughts or examples!... (From me, a supposed "Nazi," Which is a term that has no meaning annymore. Lol.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Powerful and Oppressive Tech companies: We have citizens that are blindly allegiant to tech companies that represents ideas that are completely failing thanks to the very ideals they worship. The definition of "safety" has become a dog-whistle of sorts, as well as the definition of "violence," the definition of the phrase "hate crimes," etc. Have all come to mean "things I don't like," and have utterly racist and violent implications today. Google's "Do the right thing" implies that their employees know America is NOT doing the right things right now. But to openly question that would make them feel like a white supremacist/misogynist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Different Opinions: This is why you can't try to appeal to radical left-wingers' humanity by saying: "But people will suffer if this happens!" They don't care. I have diseases that require me to get medical attention, and it has made me broke my whole adult life. Nobody cares. There are people in CONCENTRATION CAMPS in this country. (How much clearer does it need to be?) There are massive crime rates and other issues that, of no fault of their own, affect so many vulnerable people in our society. And any time a potential solution, or even an empathetic observation is made: The country BLOWS up. THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MEN SUFFER TOO. Even after you tell them it's degrading and offensive to focus on women on issues where men suffer the majority of the time. And it would take them no effort at all to acknowledge those men. They just HATE men. Which is why they want to change the definitions of words like hate speech and racism. In general, they're bullies who only respect science when it's to fallaciously appeal to nature and go on about "spectrums" and how they're essentially science-deniers in so many words. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Identification of Enemies as a Unifying Cause: LGBTQ Republicans, White people, Black Christians, Middle-Easterners, Jewish people, etc. It's the SAME strategy every time: The tech corporations use these people as scapegoats via propaganda and history revisionism, fake data, etc. To convince you that "these degenerates and undesirables" are the reason your life is going to shit. They don't want people realizing they're the reason you're suffering. They also attempt to turn people against the current government, as they offer protections for these people. This helps these tech-corporations begin to replace the government. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] It makes it easier to brutalize and fuck over lower classes and minorities, and even just poor/broke men. Since the 90s massive amounts of university professors and hate groups, all hellbent on dismantling the government, have been forming in financially well-off white areas, like upstate new york, where people have been affected drastically by their jobs being sold overseas. And angry, desperate people with shit education get indoctrinated easily into all of these arbitrary "social justice" or "dismantling" movements. They now all hate right-wing people, Christians, white people, Jews are all white supremacists to them, and they DEFINITELY hate the immigrants that disagree with their politics when not a single one of them even lives in most of their upper class secure neighborhoods... (Lmao.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Supremacy of the Media: Uh, yeah. Lmao. We have the LARGEST, most expensive media in the history of the planet. We spend FAR more than everybody else, even if A TON of that money could be far better used elsewhere. We've been conditioned, steadily more and more since the Nixon-era to believe this is necessary... And after 9/11, the news media realized that this was a perfect opportunity to expand their agenda to make even more money. This is when the country started to become particularly fascist, and the brainwashing really began. They conditioned us to blindly kiss the feet of every journalist, and to approve of every pointless, harmful cause they champion. They say it's "moral" to do that. This is the argument fascists use because they never have logic on their side. They just call you "immoral" and sic the dumb asses on you to harrass you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] A logical person sees these media for what they are: Stupid, braindead, and they're MASSIVELY contributing to brain washing and widespread suffering across countless lives, including our own children. If you criticize any of this? Well, they wouldn't want a repeat of Gamergate. They started labelling people alt-right who had different opinions banned from social media for having daring to tell journalists to "Learn to Code", for instance. (alt-right is a dog-whistle by the way. You should know that.) And again, ANY time you criticize anything the media is involved in post-Gamergate era, they can pull the: "THIS IS HARRASSMENT! HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THEM!" Card. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Rampant Sexism: Yeah. Men are under a ridiculous amount of attack. Men are harassed more than I've ever seen these days. Men in politics or in any position of power are degraded, thrown an insane amount of threats and venom, and they're mistreated. False Rape Accusations are a big joke to people, and not taken seriously. Anita Sarkeesian said "Believe all Women," to men who told her they've been falsely accused. And she started pushing their buttons until she started to cry and yelled: "Help!  Abuse!  Harassment!" when they disagreed.  And this was seen as hilarious to her and her fans. It ended up in: Jezebel articles everywhere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And Feminists feel so entitled to men's bodies and their lives mean so little that it's both disgusting and terrifying. (Hillary Clinton once said: "Women have always been the primary victims of war." Comes to mind.)
affiliation_directed_derogation	And, of course: Look at the media crucifixions recently... FULL COVERAGE FOR SMILING AT A NATIVE DUDE?! (Smirking is a form of violence, obviously.) AND JUSSIE SMOLETT GETS LET OFF THE HOOK? And the far-left (Fascist. They're fascists. It's a code word so we don't say a word associated with horrible atrocities. George Soros said that himself.) news sources, Jezebel/Young Turks/woke internet culture, CNN "news," and countless Youtube propaganda channels: Are blatantly anti-man. And one thing you might not know: Is that they very well might try to make those hate crime laws FEDERAL to affect all males nationwide. So we need to be ready for that if it comes to that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Controlled Mass Media: ^ Those sources I just mentioned, say the Soros funded propaganda sources like: BuzzFeed "News", Contrapoints, Young Turks type Youtube Channels & CNN "News," are the biggest "news" sources in the country mostly. I put quotes around "news" because nowadays? There is no line between news and propaganda these days. This is INSANELY fascist, to a terrifying degree. And a "professional news network" like CNN, with the help of Cultural Marxists shifting the culture in a direction where propaganda and blatant lies are accepted as facts, is able to literally spew revised history, fake science, fake studies, cite propagandists, insist that Cultural Marxists's lies aren't lies, knowing damn well they are. (Obviously.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With White Supremacy: ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST!!! Lol, but seriously... We are terrified beyond rationality, because of the far left propagandists telling you that white people are responsible for all things wrong in the world and throughout history. And people become SO brainwashed that you're fine with them being falsely accused and losing their jobs if it's "going to keep you safe and not hurt any feelings!" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also worth mentioning: They don't care about the stories of thousands of false rape accusations, made up hate crimes that result in innocent people suffering abuse and torture in rooms without cameras, and mass overuse of solitary confinement, which psychologists correctly deemed "torture." and "inhumane." [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] No, they're more concerned with smashing the gender binary: "Gender-Fluid" You know, our correct choice of words that biologists and academics stand behind... But they hate intellectuals, and don't care about what the academic community thinks. (We'll get into that in a bit.) Black males are a perfect example of the rise of fascism in America: Blacks, males especially, commit I think the highest amount of crime in the country. And hmm, I wonder why? Maybe because even when a gay black male wastes police resources on an elaborate hoax... Well... Let's just say it was a very revealing moment in history. [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Religion and Universities Intertwined: The changing of the meaning of words are a thing because "equality." By the way, rocks and pebbles are microaggressions. Oh, you disagree with me? Well "academics" at this super lefty university said they are. Can you prove that academics didn't tell me that? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is how fascists talk. It's all part of a game they play. ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR THIS TACTIC. Make sure you keep them talking about the facts and data. They never have any. Ever. They only know how to manipulate and play mind games and construct arguments they can't lose. And then, what they try to do is piss you off so you act up and get angry, and then it gives the appearance to dumbasses and progressives that you "lost the argument" or "got banned LOL." Never give them the satisfaction. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Hammer them down on data and facts. Don't let them pivot. Don't let them argue in "moral territory," because that's entirely "subjective." Moral could mean anything, and fascists call anything they don't like "immoral." For instance: "Immigration Policy." the thing that saves tens of billions of dollars a year and helps millions of people, is "immoral." Just keep it in "OBJECTIVE territory." Don't budge. Don't show emotion. Just expose to everybody that they have nothing to back up their arguments but feelings. Prove that all they do is argue from feelings. Not "FACTS" and "LOGIC!" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah: "Women are oppressed in America more than other countries," and "It's impossible for black people to be racist," "gender is a spectrum!" etc. You can literally pretend social science is telling you ANYTHING. "Culture Wars" have been the most gruesome in existence. They think "social science" told us that women are oppressed. You say "no, they're not..." Then they say:"Can you prove that?!" And the "social science" card effectively shuts down all rational political discourse. And they could repeat that for an hour, and people in this country won't even think that's irrational and moronic at this point. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​
affiliation_directed_derogation	It's not the first call to riot. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Commondreams is such a bullshit organization. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The "deadline" is ARBITRARY and determined by Democrats who have NO RIGHT to determine a "deadline." [linebreak]  [linebreak] Barr has said that he will have it mid month. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Democrats and media are complicit in inciting unrest over bullshit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And the left is absolutely too fucking damaged and propagandized to understand that the reason things are the way they are now (with a special prosecutor report) is because of DEMOCRATS...namely Janet Reno: [linebreak]  [linebreak] After the Starr report was released, the power of the independent counsel's office was reined in. [linebreak]  [linebreak] During Congressional hearings about the rules in the spring of 1999, Reno called big final reports a "problem." [linebreak]  [linebreak] "We believe that information obtained during a criminal investigation should, in most all cases, be made public only if there is an indictment and prosecution, not in lengthy and detailed reports filed after a decision has been made not to prosecute," Reno told Congress at the time. "The final report provides a forum for unfairly airing a target's dirty laundry.... We have come to believe that the price of the final report is often too high." [linebreak]  [linebreak] So in the summer of 1999, the old law was allowed to quietly die, and Reno's DOJ put new regulations in place, which have governed Mueller's entire investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They are the reason his final report isn't yet public. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The title: "independent counsel" became "special counsel." That word change signified a major shift in the power and independence granted to the position. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The process: The new rules put more power in the hands of the attorney general — including the right to decide how much of the investigator's concluding document would ever see the light of day. Specifically, the old rules had called for the independent counsel to submit a report directly to Congress that documented any "substantial and credible information that an impeachable offense may have been committed" — a standard Ken Starr himself later described as a "surprisingly low threshold of evidence." [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The power: Now, the only thing that the attorney general had to share with Congress was a notification that the special counsel's investigation was over, and a list of every time the AG had overruled the special counsel.

affiliation_directed_derogation	No, not until you learn some manners.  Offence is not given it is taken, and your refusal to take responsibility for understanding the effect of your words on your victims, or that your victims *are* victims, is part of the problem.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The hyperpolarisation the US is leading the world into has turned white and male fragilities into weapons, to be polished and oiled and caressed lovingly.   There is an ecosystem of businesses built on exploiting white and male fragilities, pandering and nourishing them.   There is huge grassroots support, countless volunteers doing the thankless work of rage-reading liberal sites and responding.   [linebreak] *Somebody* has to not-buy all those Gillette razor blades, and these are the people who do it.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is going to get a lot worse IMO.  Can Israel vs Palestine be implemented inside the US?  Why not?   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Liberals' smug myopia is one of the reasons Trumpism has arisen and continues to conquer the US, sweeping all before it.   I'm picking a second term of Trump, with a handover to Pence so he can abuse the presidential pardon to get / keep the crew out of jail.   [linebreak] But pardoning requires charging, and I think Trump knows where to find Dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when Trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to Pence.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR   [linebreak] You know that SJW cartoon of "I'm not racist but ..." where the friend covers their mouth with a mittened hand, and says "shush, nothing good ever comes after that"?    [linebreak] Whenever you catch yourself wanting to write "white people" or "white males", just shush yourself.  Never mind your theories about what you think you are trying to say.  Your assumptions about the existence of patriarchy and racial oppression in the US are both laughable and offensive to a lot of people whose vote is worth just as much as yours.  You can call them stupid neanderthals but they out-manoevered your side and have stacked the federal courts and  Supreme Court for a few decades.  If Trump were impeached tomorrow they still would be winning. For decades.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Many stupid people are using the misquoted and invalid 40% statistic, so here goes. TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study: [linebreak]  [linebreak] The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The "domestic violence" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c [linebreak]  [linebreak] An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws: [linebreak]  [linebreak] The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago. [linebreak]  [linebreak] More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862 [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yet another study "indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent)." A.H.

A 2000 study of seven law enforcement agencies in the Southeast and Midwest United States found 10% of officers reporting that they had slapped, punched, or otherwise injured their partners. L.

affiliation_directed_counter_speech	Idk. I feel no sympathy for pedophiles or incels who think the "solution" to their problems is a government-issue sex slave. Having said that I unsubscribed from r/inceltears because I was sick of the rhetoric along the lines of "nobody owes you sex, so suck it up buttercup." [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nobody owes anyone sex, no. But companionship and affection are actually really important to people. Those things come naturally to some. They come naturally to me. They don't come naturally to others. A lot of the time, you can't really learn how to be personable. Yes, you should have good hygiene. Yes, you should not be creepy. But some people just... are. Not out of malice but out of circumstance. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Personally, my friends, my family, my social support, my partner are all really important to me. I don't know what kind of person I'd become if I were socially isolated and people recoiled at the prospect of giving me a hug. It's entirely possible that I'd become an angry, ugly shut-in. In fact, I think most people would.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	>the group that you're choosing to identify yourself with is a prime breeding ground for violence and bigotry [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which is why I made my points in the comments of this post. Additionally, the violence from incels is marginal. There were a few attacks but 99,88% of Incels are still law abiding people.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >whose 'involuntary' identifier literally places the blame on women [linebreak]  [linebreak] No it doesn't. Involuntary literally only means something is happening against the subjects will. It carries no further judgment or meaning. [linebreak]  [linebreak] "not done by choice; done unwillingly, or without the decision or intention of the person involved" [linebreak]  [linebreak] It pretty self evident how baseless that point is. If I apply for a job and get rejected, I'm involuntarily not working in that job. Does that automatically mean I blame the Boss? No, obviously not.  [linebreak] Apart from that, that *still* doesn't refute my point. Not all Incels are evil or mean, and that's the truth.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	My goodness 40% of all police officers are abusers. That is concerning. Is that in a certain city, state, national average, world wide? Has this been validated by any meta analysis, peer reviewed journal or governmental body? What is the plan to address this as a functional police force is essential to civil society? Are we going institute trainings, stricter psych evaluations, eliminate police forces altogether? Or is the plan to simply have a lot of feelings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Either a, this is true and can be established with some kind of hard data. In which case we should probably start organizing and writing our representatives etc [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or b, this is nonsense that comes from informal polling done by one nonprofit who probably didn't even hire a reputable market research firm to conduct the polling (which very much matters in terms of data veracity).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Either way, I don't think Reddit or tumblr is the answer.
affiliation_directed_counter_speech	what do you suggest they do instead? house them until they die of old age? that's costs a lot, the money is better spent sterilizing strays to actually fix the underlying problem, which is what they do. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's already a vast surplus of pets for adoption, whether peta houses some extra or not won't change how many get adopted, and won't help as many animals as if they spent the money on sterilisations. [linebreak]  [linebreak] edit: If anyone wants to do more than just downvote and actually tell me what I said that was wrong, please do so, if not please learn basic maths, for the cost of housing and feeding a dog for 10 years you can sterilise countless strays, each saving several animals from dire fates in only 1 generation, and exponentially more as time passes, meanwhile housing the dog would save 1 dog.
